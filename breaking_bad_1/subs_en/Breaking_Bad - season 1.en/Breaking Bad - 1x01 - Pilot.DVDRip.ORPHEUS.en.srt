1
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,221
Oh, my god.

2
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,931
Christ!

3
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:17,978
Shit.

4
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,488
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

5
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:30,491
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Think, think, think.

6
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:35,704
Oh, my gosh.

7
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,319
Okay. Come on, come on, come on.

8
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,363
Come on.

9
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:16,412
My name is Walter Hartwell White.

10
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,084
I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane,
Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104.

11
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:26,130
To all law-enforcement entities,
this is not an admission of guilt.

12
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:29,216
I am speaking to my family now.

13
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,975
Skyler.

14
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:40,352
You are the love of my life.

15
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:42,521
I hope you know that.

16
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,983
Walter Jr.

17
00:02:46,191 --> 00:02:48,235
You're my big man.

18
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:53,198
There are...
There are going to be some things...

19
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:56,034
Things that you'll
come to learn about me...

20
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:57,911
...in the next few days.

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,625
I just want you to know
that no matter how it may look...

22
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:06,420
...I only had you in my heart.

23
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:14,178
Goodbye.

24
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:16,008
<i>Money before the panel
earlier this year. </i>

25
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,676
Happy birthday.

26
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,346
Look at that.

27
00:05:22,306 --> 00:05:24,683
That is veggie bacon.

28
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,685
Believe it or not. Zero cholesterol...

29
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:29,480
...and you won't even
taste the difference.

30
00:05:30,355 --> 00:05:32,107
What time do you think
you'll be home?

31
00:05:32,316 --> 00:05:33,442
Same time.

32
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,694
I don't want him
dicking you around tonight.

33
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:39,782
You get paid till 5,
you work till 5. No later.

34
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:42,743
Hey.

35
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,621
- Hey, happy birthday.
- Well, thank you.

36
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:47,664
You're late again.

37
00:05:47,873 --> 00:05:50,459
There was no hot water again.

38
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,503
I have an easy fix for that.

39
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:57,257
You wake up early, and then you get
to be the first person in the shower.

40
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,051
I have an idea.

41
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,515
How about
buy a new hot-water heater?

42
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:09,478
How's that idea?
For the million-billionth time.

43
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,441
- Did you take your echinacea?
- Yeah.

44
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,568
I think it's getting better.

45
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,238
What the hell is this?

46
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,614
- Hey.
- It's veggie bacon.

47
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:23,700
We're watching our cholesterol,
I guess.

48
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,579
Not me. I want real bacon.
Not this fake crap.

49
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,373
Too bad. Eat it.

50
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:35,045
- This smells like Band-Aids.
- Eat it.

51
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:44,430
- So how does it feel to be old?
- How does it feel to be a smart-ass?

52
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,015
Good.

53
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,269
Eat your veggie bacon.

54
00:07:09,371 --> 00:07:11,081
- You're all set?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,209
- All right, see you at home.
- Okay, see you.

56
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,590
Chemistry.

57
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:22,468
It is the study of what?

58
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,345
Anyone?

59
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,098
Ben.

60
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:31,018
- Chemicals.
- Chemicals.

61
00:07:31,226 --> 00:07:33,604
No.

62
00:07:33,812 --> 00:07:36,231
Chemistry is...

63
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,612
Well, technically,
chemistry is the study of matter.

64
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,907
But I prefer to see it
as the study of change.

65
00:07:45,115 --> 00:07:47,701
Now, just... Just think about this.

66
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,453
Electrons.

67
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:51,163
They...

68
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:53,332
...change their energy levels.

69
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,417
Molecules.

70
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:58,378
Molecules change their bonds.

71
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:03,675
Elements. They combine
and change into compounds.

72
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:06,595
Well, that's... That's all of life, right?

73
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:09,348
I mean, it's just...
It's the constant, it's the cycle.

74
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:14,394
It's solution, dissolution,
just over and over and over.

75
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:19,566
It is growth, then decay,
then transformation.

76
00:08:22,027 --> 00:08:25,572
It is fascinating, really.

77
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,538
Chad.

78
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,166
Is there something wrong
with your table?

79
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:41,880
Okay, ionic bonds.

80
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,766
Are you done?

81
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,605
Lonic bonds. Chapter six.

82
00:09:10,075 --> 00:09:12,619
One, two, three makes 10,
and 10 makes 20.

83
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:13,829
There's your receipt.

84
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:16,373
Just hand this disc
to your car-wash professional.

85
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,792
Thank you. Come again.

86
00:09:30,262 --> 00:09:33,348
He's not coming. He says he quits.

87
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:35,517
I'm gonna run the register.

88
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:38,479
Bogdan, no. We talked about this.

89
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:41,106
I'm short-handed, Walter.
What am I to do?

90
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:45,736
Walter?

91
00:09:47,196 --> 00:09:49,114
What am I to do?

92
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:11,553
Hey, Mr. White.

93
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:16,225
- Make those tyres shine, huh?
- Oh, my God.

94
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,936
You will not believe
who's cleaning Chad's car.

95
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:20,979
Mr. White.

96
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,356
From chemistry.

97
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,294
Surprise!

98
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:46,296
Happy birthday, Dad.

99
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:48,632
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

100
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:53,637
- Oh, you're so very late.
- Happy birthday.

101
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:58,684
Really, I'm serious, Skyler.
I mean, you're flat as a washboard.

102
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,602
You look awesome.

103
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:04,606
- She's not showing at all, is she?
- She's showing a little.

104
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:08,360
Carmen, this is my sister, Marie.

105
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:10,696
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

106
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:14,783
Glock 22,
that's my daily carry, okay?

107
00:11:14,992 --> 00:11:17,786
I mean, unless you're talking,
what, Plus P Plus loads...

108
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,580
...you can forget the 9 mil.

109
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,583
Shit, I seen one of those
bounce off a windshield one time.

110
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,710
- Yeah, with you shooting.
- Hey.

111
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:28,422
If you're gonna bring a gun, baby,
you gotta bring enough gun.

112
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,382
Forty calibre.

113
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:32,843
- This is awesome.
- Nice, isn't it?

114
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:36,972
- Yeah. Dad, come check this out.
- Yeah, I see it.

115
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:39,558
- Come on, take it.
- Yeah. Check it out, Walt.

116
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,481
- No, no, it's just heavy.
- That's why they hire men.

117
00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:48,192
Hey, it's not gonna bite you.

118
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,945
Looks like Keith Richards
with a glass of warm milk, doesn't he?

119
00:11:53,363 --> 00:11:55,908
Hey, Walt. Everybody, listen up,
listen up, listen up.

120
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:59,912
I'm gonna give a toast, a little toast
to my brother-in-law. Come here.

121
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:04,458
Walt, you got a brain
the size of Wisconsin...

122
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:07,002
...but we're not gonna hold that
against you.

123
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:09,546
But your heart's in the right place.

124
00:12:09,755 --> 00:12:12,257
Your heart's in the right place.
We love you, man.

125
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,010
Everybody, to Walt.

126
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,351
Oh, shit. Turn on channel three.

127
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,065
<i>At which point we apprehended three</i>
<i>individuals and placed them in custody. </i>

128
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,818
<i>I'm proud to say</i>
<i>the outstanding professionalism...</i>

129
00:12:31,026 --> 00:12:34,279
<i>...of my fellow agents</i>
<i>at the Albuquerque District Office...</i>

130
00:12:34,488 --> 00:12:37,157
<i>...resulted in a substantial amount</i>
<i>of methamphetamine...</i>

131
00:12:37,366 --> 00:12:38,826
<i>...being taken off the streets. </i>

132
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,828
<i>- Were any shots fired?</i>
<i>- No, ma'am. </i>

133
00:12:41,036 --> 00:12:43,080
<i>Our agents took the suspects</i>
<i>by surprise.</i>

134
00:12:43,288 --> 00:12:47,209
- Damn. The TV does add 10 pounds.
- Ten pounds?

135
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,003
Hey, sit and spin, both of you.

136
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:52,256
- Hank.
- What?

137
00:12:52,923 --> 00:12:55,134
Sorry. You didn't see that.

138
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:56,802
So charming.

139
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:00,973
<i>Clearly an ongoing operation. </i>
<i>One which was well-organised...</i>

140
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,725
- Hank, how much money is that?
- It's about 700 grand.

141
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:05,144
It was a pretty good haul.

142
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,230
<i>As I say, it's a good day</i>
<i>for the citizens of Albuquerque...</i>

143
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:11,233
<i>...when we can put this big a dent</i>
<i>in the local drug trade.</i>

144
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:14,486
Well, that's unusual, isn't it?
That kind of cash?

145
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,159
Well, it's not the most we ever took.
It's easy money, till we catch you.

146
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:23,454
Walt, just say the word
and I'll take you on a ride-along.

147
00:13:23,662 --> 00:13:25,956
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

148
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:28,041
Get a little excitement in your life.

149
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,919
Yeah, someday.

150
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,472
Which one's this?

151
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,934
That faux-Lalique vase
I picked up at the Super-Swap.

152
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:51,940
How's it doing?

153
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,320
Well, I met my reserve
and there's still two minutes.

154
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,120
What's up?

155
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,664
You tell me, birthday boy.

156
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,003
Oh, hey, so, what's up for Saturday?

157
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,507
Car wash.
Bogdan says he needs me.

158
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:21,011
- Till what time? Noon, 1-ish?
- Probably 2, more like it.

159
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,597
And then what after that?

160
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:26,892
Actually...

161
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:32,064
...I was thinking of driving up
to Los Alamos. They've got this...

162
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:36,068
The visitor centre has an exhibit on
that's really supposed to be...

163
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,029
- You're not gonna paint?
- No, I'll paint.

164
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:42,116
It's just that this...

165
00:14:42,324 --> 00:14:47,704
You know, this exhibition
on the Mars-rover photographs are...

166
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,291
I mean, the detail
really is just supposed to be amazing.

167
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,128
It's just that I really need you to paint
at some point.

168
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:56,463
The sooner that back bedroom
gets finished...

169
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:57,673
I know.

170
00:14:57,881 --> 00:15:00,968
And I'd do it myself, except you don't
want me on the stepladder.

171
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,554
- I will paint.
- Okay.

172
00:15:06,598 --> 00:15:09,685
- What is going on down there?
- No, it's...

173
00:15:09,893 --> 00:15:11,979
Is he asleep?

174
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:15,607
No, it's nothing. He's just...

175
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:18,944
You know. Well, you gotta be careful
about the baby and...

176
00:15:19,153 --> 00:15:22,406
Well, don't worry about the baby.
This is just for you.

177
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:26,660
We are just doing you tonight.

178
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:29,913
So just close your eyes...

179
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,916
...relax, and let it...

180
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:38,380
- Close your eyes.
- Oh, okay.

181
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,424
Okay.

182
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,677
There you go.

183
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:45,596
That's it.

184
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:48,098
That's it.

185
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,976
There you go.

186
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:53,187
Keep it going.

187
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,689
Keep it going.

188
00:15:56,273 --> 00:15:58,692
Keep it going.

189
00:15:59,234 --> 00:16:03,530
Keep... Yes! Fifty-six.

190
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:57,543
This is so embarrassing.
I am fine, honestly.

191
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,087
It's just some bug going around.

192
00:17:00,295 --> 00:17:02,673
First, my wife had it, then my son,
and now me.

193
00:17:02,881 --> 00:17:07,177
It's just... It's just like a chest cold.

194
00:17:07,386 --> 00:17:09,138
Could be some low blood sugar
as well.

195
00:17:09,346 --> 00:17:12,641
I didn't have the greatest breakfast
this morning. Honestly, I didn't.

196
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:15,769
Hey, listen, can you do me a favour?
Can you just...

197
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:17,980
...drop me off at a corner
somewhere?

198
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:21,233
No, sorry.

199
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:24,445
It's just that
I don't have the greatest insurance.

200
00:17:24,653 --> 00:17:26,447
Take a couple of deep breaths
for me.

201
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:35,289
Is there anybody
you want us to contact for you?

202
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:37,708
No. God, no.

203
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,085
Lean forward for me, would you?

204
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:47,551
- Mr. White, are you a smoker?
- No, never.

205
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,554
Why do you ask?

206
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:32,179
Mr. White?

207
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:34,890
Mr. White?

208
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,267
Yes?

209
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,604
You understood
what I've just said to you?

210
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:42,815
Yes.

211
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:45,818
Lung cancer. Inoperable.

212
00:18:47,653 --> 00:18:52,699
I'm sorry. I just need to make sure
you fully understand.

213
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,164
Best-case scenario, with chemo,
I'll live maybe another couple years.

214
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:02,584
It's just...

215
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:05,379
...you've got mustard on your...

216
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:09,925
Right there. You got mustard there.

217
00:19:10,134 --> 00:19:11,677
Right there.

218
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:22,730
So my records show that I paid it...

219
00:19:22,938 --> 00:19:25,941
...and I certainly don't feel
that we owe any late...

220
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,693
Yeah, all right.

221
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:31,280
Well, I'll check with the bank
and maybe the post office...

222
00:19:31,488 --> 00:19:33,699
...if they lost it or something.

223
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,952
All right, then.
Yeah, let me look into that. Okay.

224
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:38,245
Thank you.

225
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:42,916
Hey.

226
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,668
Hey.

227
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:50,632
Did you use the MasterCard
last month?

228
00:19:50,841 --> 00:19:53,844
Fifteen eighty-eight at Staples?

229
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:01,685
We needed printer paper.

230
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:05,439
Walt, the MasterCard's
the one we don't use.

231
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:07,900
Okay.

232
00:20:08,567 --> 00:20:11,570
So how was your day?

233
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,573
Oh, you know.

234
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:17,701
I don't know. It was...

235
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:21,872
...fine.

236
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,360
Hey, Walter.

237
00:20:51,568 --> 00:20:52,986
Walter.

238
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:56,865
Walter. I'm shorthanded.
I need you outside to do wipe downs.

239
00:20:57,074 --> 00:20:58,117
- Come on.
- What?

240
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,327
I said I need you
to do some wipe downs.

241
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,871
Are you here to work,
or to stare at the skies?

242
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,957
Come on. Let's go.

243
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,293
Come on, man.

244
00:21:08,502 --> 00:21:09,962
Fuck you, Bogdan.

245
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:13,966
- What?
- I said, "fuck you. " And your eyebrows.

246
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,639
Wipe down this.

247
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,162
Hank? Hank, it's Walt. Hey.

248
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,915
Oh, listen. I didn't wake you, did I?

249
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:30,417
Oh, good, good.

250
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:34,171
Oh, no, no.
Nothing's wrong. I just...

251
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:40,385
I've been thinking about
that offer of that ride-along.

252
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:42,930
It's the last house on the right.
See it?

253
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:45,140
Not the two-storey one,
the one next to it.

254
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:48,185
Kind of, I don't know
what do you call that?

255
00:22:48,394 --> 00:22:51,063
- Green?
- Sage.

256
00:22:51,563 --> 00:22:52,815
"Sage?"

257
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:55,275
Do you work at the fucking
Pottery Barn? Jesus.

258
00:22:55,484 --> 00:22:57,653
Sage. That's the word for it.

259
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:00,781
My fault the only word
your dumb-ass knows is "green"?

260
00:23:00,989 --> 00:23:03,992
"Cheese-dick. " I know that one.
How about that?

261
00:23:04,701 --> 00:23:07,079
Anyway, it's the sage one. See it?

262
00:23:07,329 --> 00:23:09,832
So, what tells you it's a meth lab?

263
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,291
Just our snitch.

264
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,128
Says some dude who
goes by "Cap'n Cook"...

265
00:23:14,336 --> 00:23:15,921
...lives up to his name in there.

266
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,175
Says he always adds
a dash of chilli powder.

267
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:23,262
You exuberant Mexicans.

268
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,681
"Cap'n Cook?"
That's a white boy's name.

269
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:26,974
Dopey as hell too.

270
00:23:27,182 --> 00:23:29,143
Yeah? I'll tell you what.

271
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,895
I got you 20 bucks
that says he's a beaner.

272
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:34,398
- All right.
- You're on.

273
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,777
All right.
Come on, come on, come on.

274
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:44,867
All right. School bus is clear.
You got the green light.

275
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,660
<i>Copy that. </i>

276
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,754
Watch this. Makes them shit.

277
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,592
Go, go, go, go!

278
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:14,063
Meth labs are nasty on a good day.

279
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:16,523
You mix that shit wrong
and you got mustard gas.

280
00:24:16,732 --> 00:24:18,776
Phosphine gas.

281
00:24:19,568 --> 00:24:21,737
- I think.
- Yeah, exactly.

282
00:24:21,945 --> 00:24:24,490
One whiff will kill you.
That's why the respirators.

283
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:15,165
<i>House is clear. </i>
<i>One suspect in custody. </i>

284
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:17,709
Copy that. The suspect...

285
00:25:17,918 --> 00:25:20,087
...might he be of
the Latino persuasion?

286
00:25:20,295 --> 00:25:23,257
<i>Driver's licence says</i>
<i>"Emilio Koyama. "</i>

287
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:27,761
- Asian. Pay up, sucker.
- Hey, hey. First name, Emilio.

288
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,596
That's at least half a beaner.

289
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:32,599
Tell you what, I'll let you off for a 10.

290
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:35,227
Cheer up, Gomey.

291
00:25:35,436 --> 00:25:37,646
- You people still got J. Lo.
- Hank.

292
00:25:38,689 --> 00:25:40,733
Do you think I might
get to go inside?

293
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:42,943
See the actual lab?

294
00:25:46,822 --> 00:25:50,033
Yeah. Yeah, I'll tell you what,
we're gonna go peek our heads in...

295
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:52,202
...check it out first.

296
00:25:52,411 --> 00:25:55,122
Stay here a minute. Let's go, Frank.

297
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,435
Oh, God.

298
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:25,986
Oh, God.

299
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:34,828
Oh, my God.

300
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:38,332
Pinkman?

301
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:56,809
<i>Cap'n. </i>

302
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,976
Hey. It's me. I'm alone.

303
00:27:45,023 --> 00:27:48,986
- How'd you find me?
- You're still in our filing system.

304
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:55,409
So your aunt owns this place, right?

305
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:56,744
I own it.

306
00:28:00,372 --> 00:28:01,957
Look, no one's looking for you.

307
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:03,876
Why are you here?

308
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:06,295
I was curious.

309
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,381
Honestly, I never expected
you to amount to much...

310
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:12,259
...but methamphetamine.

311
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:16,096
I didn't picture that.

312
00:28:17,473 --> 00:28:20,976
- There's a lot of money in it, huh?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

313
00:28:21,185 --> 00:28:22,895
- No?
- Not a clue.

314
00:28:25,064 --> 00:28:26,774
Cap'n Cook?

315
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:29,151
That's not you?

316
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,034
Like I said,
no one is looking for you.

317
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:41,246
Look, I don't know what you think
you're doing here, Mr. White.

318
00:28:41,455 --> 00:28:43,665
I mean, if you're planning
on giving me some...

319
00:28:43,874 --> 00:28:47,252
...bull-winder about getting right
with Jesus or turning myself in.

320
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:50,339
- Not really.
- High school was a long time ago.

321
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:55,010
You ain't <i>Welcome back, Kotter,</i>
so step off. No speeches.

322
00:28:55,219 --> 00:28:56,970
Short speech.

323
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,599
You lost your partner today.
What's-his-name.

324
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,394
Emilio?

325
00:29:04,353 --> 00:29:06,855
Emilio is going to prison.

326
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,985
The DEA took all your money,
your lab.

327
00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:14,780
You've got nothing.

328
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:16,573
Square one.

329
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:19,451
But you know the business...

330
00:29:20,494 --> 00:29:22,913
...and I know the chemistry.

331
00:29:25,874 --> 00:29:28,127
I'm thinking...

332
00:29:28,335 --> 00:29:30,504
...maybe you and I could partner up.

333
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:45,561
You wanna cook crystal meth?

334
00:29:46,895 --> 00:29:48,272
You.

335
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,942
You and me.

336
00:29:52,151 --> 00:29:53,652
That's right.

337
00:29:56,447 --> 00:30:00,784
Either that, or I turn you in.

338
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:13,714
- What the hell is this?
- Damned if I know.

339
00:30:13,922 --> 00:30:16,008
I described it as mosaic folk art.

340
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:18,844
- And somebody bought it?
- Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis.

341
00:30:19,052 --> 00:30:21,472
Fourteen dollars plus shipping. Yes.

342
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,641
At this rate,
in 50 or 60 years you'll be rich.

343
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:29,855
- So how goes the novel?
- It's not a novel, actually, which I...

344
00:30:30,064 --> 00:30:31,607
You're not writing a novel?

345
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,859
- You told me you were.
- No. Short stories.

346
00:30:34,068 --> 00:30:36,612
I said that if eventually
I have enough good ones...

347
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,572
...that maybe I'll try...

348
00:30:39,656 --> 00:30:41,283
...and publish another collection.

349
00:30:41,492 --> 00:30:43,994
Those really didn't sell.

350
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,040
I just thought a novel
would be easier to sell.

351
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,709
Yeah, well, maybe so.

352
00:30:51,502 --> 00:30:54,296
Ever want me to read anything,
I could critique it for you.

353
00:30:56,715 --> 00:30:58,092
No.

354
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:03,806
I mean, I'm just not
at that stage where I...

355
00:31:04,264 --> 00:31:07,684
- No.
- Open offer.

356
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:12,523
- So, what's up with Walt lately?
- What do you mean? He's fine.

357
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:14,608
He just seems...

358
00:31:14,817 --> 00:31:16,735
...I don't know. Quieter than usual.

359
00:31:17,653 --> 00:31:19,446
Turning 50 is a big deal.

360
00:31:19,655 --> 00:31:23,367
I mean, I'm sure as hell
not looking forward to 40.

361
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:27,079
You're gonna be a basket-case.

362
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:35,003
- So it's a mid-life crisis.
- No. He's just quiet.

363
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:39,174
- How's the sex?
- Marie, Jesus.

364
00:31:39,675 --> 00:31:41,093
I guess that answers that.

365
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:25,095
You just gonna sit there?

366
00:32:33,645 --> 00:32:35,898
Look at this. Look at this.

367
00:32:36,106 --> 00:32:40,736
Kjeldahl-style recovery flask,
800 millilitres. Very rare.

368
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:43,655
You got your usual paraphernalia,
Griffin beakers...

369
00:32:43,864 --> 00:32:47,785
...there's your Erlenmeyer flask.
But the <i>pièce de résistance...</i>

370
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:52,623
...a round bottom boiling flask,
5000 millilitres.

371
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:58,420
I cook in one of those. A big one.

372
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:01,465
One of these?

373
00:33:02,174 --> 00:33:05,385
No, this is an volumetric flask.
You wouldn't cook in one of these.

374
00:33:05,594 --> 00:33:08,597
- Yeah. I do.
- No, you don't.

375
00:33:08,806 --> 00:33:12,643
A volumetric flask is for
general mixing and titration.

376
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:15,646
You wouldn't apply heat
to a volumetric flask.

377
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:17,689
That's what a boiling flask is for.

378
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:20,234
Did you not learn nothing
from my chemistry class?

379
00:33:20,442 --> 00:33:23,487
No. You flunked me, remember?

380
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:25,948
- No wonder.
- Prick.

381
00:33:26,156 --> 00:33:29,618
And let me tell you something else.
This ain't chemistry.

382
00:33:29,827 --> 00:33:31,787
Okay, this is art.

383
00:33:31,995 --> 00:33:33,539
Cooking is art...

384
00:33:33,747 --> 00:33:36,834
...and shit I cook is the bomb,
so don't be telling me.

385
00:33:37,042 --> 00:33:39,503
Shit you cook is shit.

386
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:41,755
I saw your setup. Ridiculous.

387
00:33:41,964 --> 00:33:44,591
You and I will not make garbage.

388
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,511
We will produce a chemically pure
and stable product...

389
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,930
...that performs as advertised.
No adulterants.

390
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:53,934
- No baby formula. No chilli powder.
- No, no. Chilli P's my signature.

391
00:33:54,143 --> 00:33:55,310
Not anymore.

392
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:59,523
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

393
00:33:59,732 --> 00:34:02,192
- What the hell is this?
- Lab safety equipment.

394
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:05,863
We're also gonna have
an emergency eye wash station.

395
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:08,699
These chemicals
and their fumes are toxic.

396
00:34:08,907 --> 00:34:10,534
In case you didn't you know that.

397
00:34:10,743 --> 00:34:13,912
Well, you can dress up
like a faggot if you want. Not me.

398
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:24,214
Listen, this stuff doesn't
stay more than a day.

399
00:34:24,423 --> 00:34:27,634
- I thought we were gonna cook here.
- No, we're not gonna cook here.

400
00:34:27,843 --> 00:34:30,804
Okay, this is my house.
I don't shit where I eat.

401
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:34,308
- Well, then where are we gonna work?
- You tell me.

402
00:34:34,516 --> 00:34:38,145
This is your deal. You wanna smoke
it up, smoke it up at your house.

403
00:34:38,771 --> 00:34:42,024
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.

404
00:34:43,734 --> 00:34:45,152
Well...

405
00:34:45,819 --> 00:34:49,114
...what if we rented one of those
self-storage places?

406
00:34:49,323 --> 00:34:52,117
You know, those little orange garages?
Worked out of there?

407
00:34:52,326 --> 00:34:56,163
No, they're onto that.
They've got dogs that sniff around.

408
00:34:57,956 --> 00:35:00,793
RV, that's what you want.

409
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:03,378
What, like a Winnebago?

410
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:07,174
Yeah.

411
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:13,597
I know a dude who wants to sell his.
He just goes camping with it.

412
00:35:13,806 --> 00:35:16,183
But a mobile meth lab?
That'd be the bomb.

413
00:35:16,392 --> 00:35:19,478
I mean, you can drive way out
in the boonies.

414
00:35:20,354 --> 00:35:21,814
Be all evasive.

415
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:52,886
Dude, this isn't even seven grand,
all right? My guy wants 85.

416
00:35:53,095 --> 00:35:55,931
This is all the money
I have in the world.

417
00:35:56,265 --> 00:35:58,600
You're a drug dealer. Negotiate.

418
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:02,688
You are not how I remember
you from class.

419
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:05,691
- I mean, like, not at all.
- Yeah, well, I gotta go.

420
00:36:05,899 --> 00:36:07,317
Wait. Wait. Hold up.

421
00:36:08,694 --> 00:36:11,947
Tell me why you're doing this.
Seriously.

422
00:36:12,698 --> 00:36:16,368
- Why do you do it?
- Money, mainly.

423
00:36:17,745 --> 00:36:21,665
- There you go.
- No, come on, man.

424
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:24,293
Some straight like you,
giant stick up his ass...

425
00:36:24,501 --> 00:36:27,796
...all a sudden at age, what, 60,
he's just gonna break bad?

426
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:30,382
- I'm 50.
- It's weird, is all.

427
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,760
Okay, it doesn't compute. Listen...

428
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:35,554
...if you've gone crazy or something...

429
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:39,558
...I mean, if you've gone crazy,
or depressed.

430
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:41,894
I'm just saying.

431
00:36:42,978 --> 00:36:44,855
That's something
I need to know about.

432
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:47,232
Okay, I mean, that affects me.

433
00:36:52,988 --> 00:36:55,074
I am awake.

434
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,120
What?

435
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:05,250
Buy the RV.

436
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,296
We start tomorrow.

437
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:16,720
How's it coming in there?

438
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,181
Fine.

439
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:27,815
Do you want me or your dad?

440
00:37:29,691 --> 00:37:31,777
Dad.

441
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:50,379
So how are those feeling in the waist?
Are they too tight?

442
00:37:50,587 --> 00:37:52,840
You don't want to get them
if they're too tight.

443
00:37:53,048 --> 00:37:56,260
They're... They're pretty shrunk.

444
00:37:56,468 --> 00:37:59,096
Are you sure you don't want the...
Like a different kind?

445
00:37:59,304 --> 00:38:01,056
Like, you know, the skinny jeans...

446
00:38:01,265 --> 00:38:03,809
...because those are in style.
The skaters where them.

447
00:38:04,435 --> 00:38:07,604
- Do I look like a skater?
- All right.

448
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:10,816
Mom, get them, my big boy pants.

449
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:16,321
Mommy, could you zip up
my big boy pants.

450
00:38:22,035 --> 00:38:23,120
- Don't.
- What?

451
00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:27,666
- Don't.
- Walt.

452
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:32,296
I have no idea.

453
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:35,841
No, you know what?
Don't even look at them.

454
00:38:36,049 --> 00:38:39,053
- They're obviously very stupid.
- Yep.

455
00:38:39,261 --> 00:38:40,345
Yeah.

456
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,559
I think that... I think those jeans
look really good on you.

457
00:38:45,768 --> 00:38:48,520
I think you should get them
if you like them, okay?

458
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:51,648
Why don't you hang out here
for a second. I'll be right back.

459
00:38:51,857 --> 00:38:52,858
Fine.

460
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,863
Hey, Mommy, I think I pinched a loaf
in my brand new big boy pants.

461
00:39:05,245 --> 00:39:08,415
- What are you doing?
- What's wrong? Having trouble walking?

462
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:11,335
Get off me! Get off me!

463
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:16,215
I'll mess you up, man.

464
00:39:16,423 --> 00:39:18,675
You'll have one shot.
You'd better make it good.

465
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:21,428
You waiting for, your girlfriends?
Better go.

466
00:39:21,637 --> 00:39:24,598
You'd better go. Take it.
Take your shot. Take it!

467
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:26,892
Come on.

468
00:39:27,476 --> 00:39:29,561
- Come on.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

469
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:31,105
Let's go.

470
00:39:32,731 --> 00:39:34,233
Psycho.

471
00:40:09,893 --> 00:40:12,354
Yeah, nothing but cows.

472
00:40:12,563 --> 00:40:15,858
Got some big cow house
way out that way, like two miles...

473
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:18,569
...but I don't see nobody.

474
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:23,323
- "Cow house"?
- Yeah. Where they live.

475
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:24,742
The cows.

476
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:30,038
Whatever, man.
Shit, yeah. Let's cook here.

477
00:40:32,124 --> 00:40:33,792
Cow house.

478
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:35,753
God help me.

479
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,977
- What are you doing?
- These are my good clothes.

480
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:55,272
You can't go home
smelling like a meth lab.

481
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:57,983
Yeah, you can. I do.

482
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:03,781
Those? Wow. Those...
You're keeping those on right?

483
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:14,625
Come on. Daylight's burning.

484
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,336
Oh, my God.

485
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:27,554
Wow, this is a good look for you.

486
00:41:27,763 --> 00:41:31,016
I mean, you're maybe only
the world's second-biggest homo.

487
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:33,602
Would you shut up and help me?

488
00:41:34,103 --> 00:41:36,355
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

489
00:41:36,563 --> 00:41:41,110
- Work it. Baby, work it.
- Turn that off.

490
00:42:47,676 --> 00:42:49,928
This is glass-grade.

491
00:42:50,804 --> 00:42:56,185
You got... Jesus, you got crystals
in here two inches, three inches long.

492
00:42:56,393 --> 00:42:57,978
This is pure glass.

493
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,899
You're a goddamn artist.

494
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:05,194
This is art, Mr. White.

495
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:07,780
Well, actually,
it's just basic chemistry...

496
00:43:07,988 --> 00:43:10,741
...but thank you, Jesse.
I'm glad it's acceptable.

497
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:13,702
Acceptable?
You're the goddamn Iron Chef.

498
00:43:13,994 --> 00:43:16,663
Every jibhead from here to Timbuktu's
gonna want a taste.

499
00:43:18,165 --> 00:43:23,087
- Man, I gotta try this.
- No. No.

500
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,048
No. We only sell it. We don't use it.

501
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:28,967
Okay, since when?

502
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:32,304
Listen, you've been watching
way too much <i>Miami Vice</i>.

503
00:43:32,513 --> 00:43:33,722
That ain't happening.

504
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:40,646
So, what now?

505
00:43:42,523 --> 00:43:43,732
How do we proceed?

506
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:50,030
We cook more tomorrow.

507
00:43:51,156 --> 00:43:52,991
Meantime...

508
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,786
...I know just the guy to talk to.

509
00:43:57,371 --> 00:43:59,039
Get him. Come on.

510
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:08,215
Hey, yo. Kraze, how you doing,
my man?

511
00:44:10,509 --> 00:44:14,638
Hey, you got a new dog.
Right on, man.

512
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:16,849
What's his name?

513
00:44:17,933 --> 00:44:21,895
Yeah, I had a dog like that once,
except maybe like twice as big.

514
00:44:22,104 --> 00:44:23,689
Super-purebred.

515
00:44:23,897 --> 00:44:27,443
Now, me personally, I would train him
to go straight for the nutsack.

516
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:29,695
Just shut your mouth
and show me your money.

517
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:31,405
I ain't buying, <i>ese</i>.

518
00:44:32,406 --> 00:44:34,074
I'm selling.

519
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:46,712
Tell me that ain't the finest scante
you ever laid eyes on.

520
00:44:47,713 --> 00:44:50,049
Go ahead. Try it.

521
00:44:50,257 --> 00:44:52,843
Hey, poochie. How you doing?

522
00:44:53,635 --> 00:44:55,679
Jesus Christ.

523
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,183
Yeah. Booya! See, what'd I say?

524
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:01,769
- It's all right.
- It's all right?

525
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:03,729
It's all right? Yeah, it's all right.

526
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:07,191
- So what? You're back in business?
- Hell, yeah, I'm back.

527
00:45:07,524 --> 00:45:10,903
With a vengeance.
<i>Vato loco</i> gotta make a living.

528
00:45:11,111 --> 00:45:13,864
You know, with your cousin
gone away and all...

529
00:45:14,615 --> 00:45:17,326
And listen, homes, about that...

530
00:45:18,952 --> 00:45:21,413
Really broke me up about Emilio.

531
00:45:22,164 --> 00:45:24,124
That dude is like my brother.

532
00:45:24,458 --> 00:45:27,336
- You okay? You talk to him?
- Yeah, I talk to him.

533
00:45:27,669 --> 00:45:31,632
Said when the feds came, you were
out sticking it in some neighbour lady.

534
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,095
- Hey, you know, I got lucky twice.
- I don't know, man.

535
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:38,013
Emilio...

536
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,518
...he thinks maybe
you dimed on him.

537
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:46,146
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
That is bullshit.

538
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,066
That is bullshit, Krazy, eh?

539
00:45:49,274 --> 00:45:51,902
I should kick his punk ass
for even thinking that.

540
00:45:52,486 --> 00:45:54,947
You know what? Next time
you talk to Emilio...

541
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:56,824
...you tell him for me, all right?

542
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:04,039
Why don't you tell him yourself?
Made bail this morning.

543
00:46:04,248 --> 00:46:07,126
Go ahead, <i>pendejo</i>. Kick my ass.

544
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:08,877
Hey, listen...

545
00:46:12,047 --> 00:46:13,966
Where did you get this?

546
00:46:15,884 --> 00:46:18,679
Because I know your little punk ass
didn't cook it.

547
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:51,962
Damn, man. What are you,
some kind of nudist?

548
00:46:53,964 --> 00:46:57,259
Yeah, that's some stone-fine tick-tick
you been cooking there, <i>ese</i>.

549
00:46:57,468 --> 00:46:59,094
How about you come work for me?

550
00:47:00,888 --> 00:47:03,515
I'd be willing to sell it to you...

551
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:05,434
...if the price is right.

552
00:47:16,487 --> 00:47:18,530
Out here all by yourself, huh?

553
00:47:26,163 --> 00:47:30,209
Hey, I know you.
He was there when I got busted.

554
00:47:30,417 --> 00:47:32,419
- He's with the DEA.
- No.

555
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,672
You <i>rata</i> snitch motherfucker.

556
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,383
Run, Mr. White! Run!

557
00:47:47,810 --> 00:47:49,311
I say we cap them both.

558
00:47:56,777 --> 00:47:58,779
You really cook up that batch?

559
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:03,409
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

560
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:07,996
- It's a damn shame.
- Wait.

561
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:09,581
Wait a minute.

562
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,920
Listen to me.
I'll teach you my recipe, huh?

563
00:48:15,129 --> 00:48:17,297
What do you say?
You wanna cook like me?

564
00:48:20,676 --> 00:48:22,636
You let us both live...

565
00:48:23,887 --> 00:48:27,516
...and I will teach you, huh?

566
00:48:57,004 --> 00:48:58,964
Put the cigarette out.

567
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,177
Please...

568
00:49:46,678 --> 00:49:50,099
Move it, homes. You got all day?

569
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:54,186
Okay.

570
00:52:19,206 --> 00:52:20,666
Shit!

571
00:54:05,562 --> 00:54:07,147
What happened?

572
00:54:09,858 --> 00:54:12,403
Hey, what'd you do to them?

573
00:54:14,363 --> 00:54:18,075
Red phosphorus in the presence
of moisture and accelerated by heat...

574
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:20,619
...yields phosphorus hydride.

575
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:23,664
Phosphine gas.

576
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:26,208
One good whiff and...

577
00:54:50,858 --> 00:54:52,484
We gotta...

578
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:57,781
We gotta clean this up.

579
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,830
Where were you?

580
00:55:55,214 --> 00:55:56,799
Walt...

581
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:01,887
I don't know what's
been going on with you lately...

582
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:04,848
...but...
- Nothing, honey. I'm fine.

583
00:56:05,057 --> 00:56:09,269
Whatever it is, I'll tell you this.

584
00:56:09,853 --> 00:56:13,065
I do not like it
when you don't talk to me.

585
00:56:14,483 --> 00:56:17,444
The worst thing you can do
is shut me out.

586
00:57:03,532 --> 00:57:05,242
Walt...

587
00:57:07,703 --> 00:57:12,166
Oh, Walt, is that you?

1
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:08,567
Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:12,071
I mean, technically it says
"curriculum vitae"...

3
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:16,241
...which I think is more professional,
but, you know...

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,951
...same thing, pretty much.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,953
That's... Wow, great.

6
00:00:20,162 --> 00:00:23,123
This position truly is a
no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

7
00:00:23,332 --> 00:00:26,543
And it doesn't really say it here...

8
00:00:26,752 --> 00:00:30,631
...but I have a solid background
in sales.

9
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,758
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so...

10
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,135
- That's excellent, but...
- Excellent.

11
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,470
I just...

12
00:00:36,678 --> 00:00:39,431
...I really feel I could be a major...

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,726
...major asset to your sales force.

14
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:47,648
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

15
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:49,525
This isn't actually a sales job.

16
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:53,445
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you
for a sales position...

17
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,698
...but all our agents
need to be licensed...

18
00:00:55,906 --> 00:00:58,325
...have at least two years
on-the-job experience...

19
00:00:58,534 --> 00:01:00,077
...and usually a college degree.

20
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:06,917
What you'll be doing is more like...

21
00:01:07,126 --> 00:01:08,961
...advertising.

22
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:23,475
Hey, Jesse.

23
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,811
Hey, man.

24
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,146
Yo, man.

25
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,231
- What up?
- Badger?

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,900
Where you been keeping yourself?

27
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:34,570
Nice duds.

28
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:36,488
Yeah, you too.

29
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,365
Thanks.

30
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:41,410
Yo, why would you wanna do
this lame-ass job, anyway?

31
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:43,412
I mean, no offence.

32
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,080
Because I'm on probation, yo.

33
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,625
I gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

34
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:51,879
Upstanding citizen, all that shit.

35
00:01:52,087 --> 00:01:54,840
It's really good exercise too.

36
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,676
You can't just stand there,
you have to spin the arrow.

37
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,138
There's all these moves
you have to learn, like "the helicopter. "

38
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:07,561
Yeah. See, yeah?

39
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,104
That one's a bitch.

40
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:10,939
I'm not very good at it yet.

41
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,359
You really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

42
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:15,819
- Yeah.
- Hey, anyways...

43
00:02:17,029 --> 00:02:19,239
...thanks for the toke.
- Any time.

44
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:20,574
Speaking of which...

45
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:25,120
...you think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

46
00:02:25,913 --> 00:02:28,665
No, I've been out of the business
for a while.

47
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:31,126
Actually, now thinking about retiring.

48
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:33,337
- What? No.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:35,923
That stuff you made is unbelievable.

50
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:37,508
It was pretty awesome.

51
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:38,884
Retirement?

52
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,387
I can't be hearing this.

53
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:45,641
No, man, I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

54
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,227
I mean, I was doing
most of the work...

55
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:52,481
...but he was an asshole, so.

56
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:55,943
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by and...

57
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:58,862
Yo, I can hook you up
with some pseudo.

58
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:00,781
Major pseudo.

59
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:03,367
I got channels, bro.

60
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,993
We could partner up.

61
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,372
No pressure.

62
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,958
No pressure.
Just think about it, all right?

63
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,711
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

64
00:03:23,345 --> 00:03:25,723
Yo, this way to savings.

65
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,017
Save your dollar bills, y'all.

66
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,358
<i>Big savings</i>
<i>This way and save</i>

67
00:03:38,152 --> 00:03:41,822
Come on! Save some money.

68
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,666
It's a stupid gift.

69
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,418
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

70
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,294
I don't know what I was thinking.

71
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:15,423
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

72
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:17,341
- Walt.
- What?

73
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,135
We have to go.

74
00:04:19,844 --> 00:04:21,220
I know, I'm not complaining.

75
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:22,638
Yes, you are.

76
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,268
Look, we need this.

77
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:30,688
We've been through a lot
lately. Okay?

78
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:36,986
Jesus, guess we didn't get
the "beige" memo.

79
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,238
We're okay.

80
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:42,742
Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

81
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,577
Honey, you look fine.

82
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:48,205
Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

83
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,169
God, would you look at that.
The invitation said "no gifts. "

84
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:55,713
So? Come on.

85
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,216
Sir, I'll take that for you.

86
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,596
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

87
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,308
Oh, look, there's Elliott.

88
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,102
Oh, come on, let's go say hello.

89
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,022
Elliott.

90
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,107
Walt.

91
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,485
You made it.

92
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,694
Happy birthday.

93
00:05:18,903 --> 00:05:21,113
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Skyler.

94
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,241
Hi. Oh, that's right.

95
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,786
Great to see you.
You look beautiful, as always.

96
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,206
Well, these days a little more big
than beautiful, but...

97
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:33,834
Of course, congratulations.
That was such great news.

98
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:37,672
- Thank you.
- Gretchen, look who's here.

99
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,802
It's been ages.

100
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,805
Oh, it's so good to see you.

101
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:48,641
It's really good.

102
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,434
Skyler, welcome. Congratulations.

103
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:52,937
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

104
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,690
- When are you due?
- In about 10 more weeks.

105
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,944
And actually, we recently found out
that it's a girl.

106
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,822
- Oh, that's so wonderful.
- Yeah.

107
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,491
Yeah, we've been thinking about it
for ourselves.

108
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,951
Yeah, thinking about it.

109
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,123
Oh, hey, by the way...

110
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:15,209
...securing that patent
was just amazing.

111
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,296
I mean, the work
that your company is doing...

112
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,215
Congratulations to both of you.

113
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:25,261
- Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot.
- Yeah. Oh, well, now.

114
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:26,762
Elliott.

115
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,431
Excuse us, we gotta say hi.

116
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,474
Make yourselves at home,
we'll catch up.

117
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:31,976
Sure, sure. Okay.

118
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,561
- Okay.
- So glad you're here.

119
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,271
- Thank you.
- Bye.

120
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,148
John, Missy. How are you?

121
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,899
Shall we?

122
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,653
Congratulations. Happy birthday.

123
00:07:57,228 --> 00:07:58,437
Walt?

124
00:07:58,646 --> 00:08:00,189
I thought that was you.

125
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:01,565
Farley.

126
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,442
Long time no see.

127
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:05,653
- This is Walter White.
- Hello.

128
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,530
Back at Caltech, he was...

129
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:10,366
You were just a master
of crystallography.

130
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:14,662
I remember this one time we were
stuck on this protein problem...

131
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,580
...for weeks.

132
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,083
You just breezed right in...

133
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,043
...and you had one word for us...

134
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:24,088
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

135
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,883
They generate pure and more complete
patterns than x-ray beams.

136
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:31,137
Data collection
takes a fraction of the time.

137
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,723
This is the White in Gray Matter.

138
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:38,102
- Tell them, Walt.
- Okay.

139
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:41,480
Well, back when Elliott and I
were in grad school...

140
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,274
...we came up with the name.

141
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,485
Schwartz, black. Walter White.

142
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,613
So together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

143
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:52,366
- Cute, huh?
- So you run the company with Elliott?

144
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:55,327
No. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

145
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,706
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I gravitated toward education.

146
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,083
What university?

147
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:07,381
Oh, wow, it's a Stratocaster.

148
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,344
Not just any Strat.
That's one of Clapton's.

149
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,429
No way.

150
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:18,059
"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle rash,
Eric Clapton. "

151
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,020
Thank you. This is beautiful.

152
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,064
- Why is he doing this?
- Beautiful.

153
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,066
What is he, like, 8 years old?

154
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,026
Here, honey.

155
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,572
Thanks.

156
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:32,948
Oh, this is from Walt.

157
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,784
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

158
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,037
Hey.

159
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,831
Let's see what we got.

160
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:48,422
Yum Good Ramen.

161
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:04,689
This is what Walt and I lived on...

162
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:07,274
...for 10 months straight...

163
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:10,277
...while we were working
on our thesis.

164
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:13,406
Sold them down at Ralstow's
in the hardware isle.

165
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,408
Right next to the... What was it?

166
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,743
- Sterno. Yeah.
- The Sterno.

167
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,995
Yeah, ten for a dollar ninety-nine.

168
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:23,165
To this day,
I am convinced these noodles...

169
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,501
...were responsible for our success.

170
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,837
This was our lifeblood.

171
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:31,549
Man, where'd you find these? I thought
they'd been outlawed years ago.

172
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,302
I love it.

173
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,931
Thank you, Walt.

174
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:41,267
Well.

175
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,394
For the man who has everything.

176
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,688
- No, no, no.
- It was.

177
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,732
- No, you remember the fat guy.
- Yes.

178
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,608
We used to call him Snot Trough.

179
00:10:49,817 --> 00:10:51,402
He had that thing under his nose.

180
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,113
- What do you call that thing?
- That was Dobkins.

181
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,241
That was the same guy
who always smelled like chocolate milk.

182
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,160
- It was.
- No, no, no.

183
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,704
It wasn't Dobkins, it was...

184
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:05,333
Anyway, I swear to Christ,
he used to iron those patches...

185
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,836
...onto the elbows
of his members-only jacket...

186
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:11,505
...because he thought it made him
look distinguished.

187
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,799
- Didn't it? I thought it...
- No.

188
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,345
Oh, God.
Well, here's to Snot Trough.

189
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,305
- To Snot Trough.
- Wherever you may be.

190
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,140
God bless him.

191
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:27,813
Do you remember the professor who
used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

192
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:31,067
Yes. All you had to do
was mention the Bunsen burner...

193
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:33,277
...and he was off on a rant.

194
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:36,530
"Oh, he didn't invent it. "
Do you remember the waving?

195
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,492
"He just improved it," you know.

196
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,327
It was easy to kill 15 minutes.

197
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:42,995
Yeah.

198
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,623
Oh, God.

199
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,792
I miss this, Walt.

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,586
Yeah. Me too.

201
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,880
Listen, we ought to get together
more often.

202
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,508
Skyler and I would love
to have you and Gretchen...

203
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,343
...over for dinner sometime.

204
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,387
Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely.

205
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:05,393
But, you know, what I mean is that
you and I should work together again.

206
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:10,439
- Are you gonna teach high school?
- No, no, no, seriously.

207
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,900
What's stopping us?

208
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,155
Wait a minute, Elliott,
what are you...?

209
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,075
Are you asking me to come work
for you at Gray Matter?

210
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:23,285
Yeah, why not? You'd fit right in.

211
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:26,747
You're brilliant,
you got a ton of experience.

212
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,541
Well...

213
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,710
...I wouldn't really know
where to begin.

214
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,169
I mean...

215
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:34,463
God, you have no idea.

216
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:38,634
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard...

217
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,679
...and trying to get these kids to learn
the periodic table.

218
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,723
Look, I understand.

219
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:47,435
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

220
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:51,355
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

221
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:54,275
You know when you've
been trying to crack some problem...

222
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,527
...for months on end,
you get tunnel vision.

223
00:12:56,736 --> 00:13:01,574
One guy thinking outside of the box,
you may be exactly what we need.

224
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:20,259
Well, listen, Elliott, it...

225
00:13:20,468 --> 00:13:23,763
The offer is very appealing,
it really is, I thank you.

226
00:13:25,181 --> 00:13:27,350
But there's...

227
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,810
There's something you should know.

228
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:36,817
I have some personal issues.

229
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,320
Look, there's nothing
we can't work out.

230
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,781
Well, yeah, but...

231
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:44,575
...it's complicated.

232
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:46,952
We can help you.

233
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,872
We have excellent health insurance.

234
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,168
The best.

235
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:17,608
Hey, did you try those
prosciutto-wrapped figs?

236
00:14:17,817 --> 00:14:19,735
They were, like, wow.
They were just...

237
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,363
I must have had about 30
of those suckers.

238
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,615
Oh, and the seafood table,
did you see that?

239
00:14:24,824 --> 00:14:28,202
They had lobster tail,
they had crab legs, like, shrimp.

240
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:29,954
They had...

241
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:36,085
- Walt.
- What the hell did you say to Elliott?

242
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,129
- What?
- You told him about the cancer...

243
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:41,173
...didn't you? Didn't you?

244
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:43,551
I can't believe it.

245
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:47,346
Okay, we were talking,
he asked how you were doing...

246
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,891
...and I am sorry, but I don't have
the best poker face these days...

247
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,476
...where that's concerned.

248
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:56,313
He knew something was wrong
with you, and he pressed me.

249
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,024
He pressed you? Come on.

250
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:00,860
Walt, when it came right down to it...

251
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,446
...I didn't know what to do
but tell him the truth.

252
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:07,408
The truth? Well, how about
you just said, "He's fine," huh?

253
00:15:09,702 --> 00:15:12,663
You could have said that. "He's fine. "
It would have been done.

254
00:15:12,872 --> 00:15:14,582
I don't like the way you're talking.

255
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,418
I don't like the way you talk
about private affairs...

256
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:21,630
...to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

257
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,258
Well, what exactly did he say to you?

258
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,801
- He offered me a job.
- What?

259
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,513
Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf,
you know.

260
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:32,141
Some face-saving bullshit...

261
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,519
...that allowed me
to generously accept his charity.

262
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:38,189
And then when I turned that down,
he flat out...

263
00:15:38,397 --> 00:15:40,441
...offered to pay for my treatment.

264
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,736
Which is exactly what
you expected him to do, didn't you?

265
00:15:44,278 --> 00:15:45,279
- Walt.
- Didn't you?

266
00:15:45,488 --> 00:15:49,200
- No. I did not put him up...
- Please. Come on. Come on.

267
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,871
Okay, what did you say?

268
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:57,708
Walt?

269
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,127
What do you think I said?

270
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,422
Why? Walt.

271
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,809
- Ready to go?
- I'm taking the bus.

272
00:16:58,328 --> 00:17:00,413
Okay.

273
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:04,376
Bye, honey.

274
00:17:42,247 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey, dude. Are these bullet holes?

275
00:17:47,002 --> 00:17:49,963
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know...

276
00:17:50,172 --> 00:17:52,215
...ventilation.

277
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:54,301
Cool.

278
00:17:55,761 --> 00:17:58,930
Nice setup, huh?

279
00:17:59,139 --> 00:18:01,224
- Man.
- This is nothing, man.

280
00:18:01,433 --> 00:18:04,311
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware...

281
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,692
...until my dumb-ass ex-partner drove
us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.

282
00:18:10,901 --> 00:18:13,445
Big-ass beaker, huh?

283
00:18:13,653 --> 00:18:17,073
Hey, wait, wait, no, that's...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

284
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:19,326
This is a beaker.

285
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:24,206
Here's a Griffin beaker.
Here's a volumetric beaker.

286
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:27,209
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

287
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,711
You got...

288
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,255
You really know your shit.

289
00:18:32,464 --> 00:18:33,965
It's just basic chemistry, yo.

290
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:37,469
So...

291
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,638
...you got something for me?

292
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:41,515
Hells, yeah.

293
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,735
Okay.

294
00:18:53,944 --> 00:18:56,071
We're in business.

295
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,322
Right on, Badger.

296
00:18:57,531 --> 00:18:59,825
Dude, check this out.

297
00:19:00,492 --> 00:19:01,701
Jesus.

298
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,372
- What are you bringing that for?
- Hunting.

299
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,874
We might see javelinas.

300
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,531
Are you gonna help me or what?

301
00:19:45,036 --> 00:19:46,872
Hey.

302
00:19:51,418 --> 00:19:52,669
Badger!

303
00:20:03,513 --> 00:20:05,724
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

304
00:20:50,977 --> 00:20:52,771
Let's see the money.

305
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,523
Here.

306
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:56,817
I need five each.
Come on, two more.

307
00:20:57,025 --> 00:20:58,819
Here.

308
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,946
What about him?

309
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:04,074
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

310
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:05,534
Whatever.

311
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,078
What about that guy?

312
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:10,080
No, he looks like a businessman.

313
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:11,289
So what?

314
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:14,126
So, businessmen
are always in a hurry.

315
00:21:14,334 --> 00:21:17,587
They're always, like, going
to some meeting or something.

316
00:21:17,796 --> 00:21:19,756
Seriously, he's just gonna say no.

317
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,635
Hey, hey, this guy.

318
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:24,845
This is our guy.

319
00:21:25,053 --> 00:21:26,096
You're up.

320
00:21:26,304 --> 00:21:28,098
Why do I have to do it?

321
00:21:28,306 --> 00:21:30,225
Give me the crutches
and I'll go do it.

322
00:21:32,185 --> 00:21:33,854
Shit.

323
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,400
Excuse me, hey...

324
00:21:38,608 --> 00:21:40,777
...we forgot our IDs,
and we were wondering...

325
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:44,614
...if you could do us a favour
and buy us a six-pack?

326
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:47,367
You know,
what you're asking is illegal.

327
00:21:48,827 --> 00:21:50,078
No, it's not.

328
00:21:50,287 --> 00:21:52,289
Yeah, it is.

329
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:54,833
Oh, shit.

330
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:59,421
Guess you win the jackpot.

331
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,091
This is not how I wanted to spend
my night off.

332
00:22:03,842 --> 00:22:06,428
Consider this your first
and last warning.

333
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:09,639
- Yes, sir.
- You're lucky you got a good dad, here.

334
00:22:17,731 --> 00:22:19,775
The other guys had to run.

335
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,778
I couldn't talk my way out of it.

336
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:25,113
Not cool, man. Not cool.

337
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:28,825
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

338
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,912
I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

339
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:34,331
How do you think
that'd make him feel?

340
00:22:44,591 --> 00:22:47,135
I don't even know what to say to you.

341
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:51,640
Just go.

342
00:22:51,848 --> 00:22:54,017
I'll deal with you later.

343
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,983
Where's Walt?

344
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:07,114
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Your guess is as good as mine.

345
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:09,699
Listen, do me a favour, all right?

346
00:23:09,908 --> 00:23:11,785
Don't tell him about the kid.

347
00:23:11,993 --> 00:23:14,913
He's just a teenager
trying to score some beer.

348
00:23:15,831 --> 00:23:17,374
You know...

349
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,376
...growing pains.

350
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:23,880
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

351
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:26,758
First the pot, then this.

352
00:23:26,967 --> 00:23:28,385
The pot?

353
00:23:31,555 --> 00:23:34,724
- You told me the kid was smoking.
- That's what Skyler told me.

354
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:39,187
- I mean, you may as well have.
- I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.

355
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:42,190
I was talking about Walt.

356
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:46,403
Excuse me?

357
00:23:46,611 --> 00:23:48,947
He admitted it.

358
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,367
He said he liked it.

359
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:54,661
Walt?

360
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,542
Shit.

361
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:06,506
I didn't think he had it in him.

362
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:08,800
- It's like he's not himself lately.
- Yeah.

363
00:24:09,009 --> 00:24:10,093
I mean...

364
00:24:10,302 --> 00:24:13,680
...why would anyone in their right mind
choose not to do treatment?

365
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:16,516
Especially when
it's completely paid for.

366
00:24:16,933 --> 00:24:18,602
Why is he doing this?

367
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,772
You know what we need to do?

368
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,941
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us...

369
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:27,360
...and get everything out
on the table.

370
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,905
Talk it all through.

371
00:24:30,113 --> 00:24:33,116
- You mean an intervention?
- No, no.

372
00:24:33,325 --> 00:24:36,703
Just a family meeting.

373
00:24:36,912 --> 00:24:40,040
Where everyone
can voice their concerns...

374
00:24:40,248 --> 00:24:42,584
...and be heard.

375
00:24:50,592 --> 00:24:52,677
You are a genius, bro.

376
00:24:52,886 --> 00:24:54,846
This cankenstein is unreal.

377
00:24:55,055 --> 00:24:57,182
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that suit...

378
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,602
...because we're gonna
make some mad dough.

379
00:25:01,561 --> 00:25:03,522
It's not right.

380
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,232
What do you mean,
it's not right?

381
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:10,570
It's cloudy.
It's not supposed to be cloudy.

382
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:13,490
Okay, that last time, it was glass.

383
00:25:13,698 --> 00:25:18,620
So what? Cloudy, not cloudy?
It looks good enough to me.

384
00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:22,457
Good enough.

385
00:25:24,459 --> 00:25:27,671
Wait, wait.
Yo, what are you doing?

386
00:25:33,093 --> 00:25:35,762
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that.

387
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:38,098
It's not for you,
it's for our customers.

388
00:25:38,306 --> 00:25:40,225
They're gonna demand
a certain standard.

389
00:25:40,434 --> 00:25:43,353
What? What...? What are you...?

390
00:25:43,728 --> 00:25:46,022
- What?
- We'll just do it again.

391
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:48,150
Until we get it right.

392
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:15,927
Walt.

393
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:20,307
Please have a seat and join us.

394
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:14,402
- We can do better.
- Don't you fucking think about it.

395
00:27:14,611 --> 00:27:17,447
- Hey.
- Come on.

396
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:20,784
Three entire pounds
of pseudo wasted.

397
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:23,120
Do you know how long
I had to spin that sign?

398
00:27:23,328 --> 00:27:27,207
- Get off me, psycho.
- Helicopter, bitch!

399
00:27:36,174 --> 00:27:38,051
God!

400
00:27:42,264 --> 00:27:43,265
Asshole.

401
00:27:46,143 --> 00:27:47,185
Open the door.

402
00:28:08,999 --> 00:28:11,918
Come back here, you bitch!

403
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:13,628
I'm gonna mess you up!

404
00:28:15,422 --> 00:28:17,257
This isn't funny!

405
00:28:26,349 --> 00:28:29,853
I really need to understand
your thought process...

406
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:31,938
...because clearly I don't.

407
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:36,943
I feel that this decision
you've made...

408
00:28:37,152 --> 00:28:39,488
...is not only
not in your best interest...

409
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:43,116
...it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

410
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:46,620
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet, please. L...

411
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:48,830
I have the talking pillow.

412
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,044
Everybody gets to speak their minds,
remember?

413
00:28:54,252 --> 00:28:56,880
And then you'll get your chance.

414
00:28:57,422 --> 00:29:01,051
Money has always been
an issue for us, I'll give you that.

415
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,387
But now that Elliott is more than willing
to pitch in...

416
00:29:04,596 --> 00:29:07,849
Walt, I know, I understand
that it's hard for you to accept help.

417
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:10,102
Maybe it's the way you were raised.

418
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,187
But, honey...

419
00:29:12,395 --> 00:29:16,316
...it's okay to lean on people
now and again.

420
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:18,777
You need this treatment.

421
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:21,863
And nothing can stop you
from getting it...

422
00:29:22,072 --> 00:29:23,740
...except you.

423
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:34,793
- Am I allowed to respond?
- In a minute.

424
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:38,922
I think we need
to go around the circle first.

425
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:43,009
Hank, would you like to start?

426
00:29:46,847 --> 00:29:50,225
Yeah. Okay, well...

427
00:29:50,434 --> 00:29:52,727
- What I would say is...
- Take the talking pillow.

428
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,778
All right, look, buddy...

429
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:06,825
...I know I don't get to
tell you this enough...

430
00:30:08,368 --> 00:30:10,620
...but I care about you.

431
00:30:11,288 --> 00:30:13,373
A hell of a lot.

432
00:30:14,082 --> 00:30:15,876
And this cancer thing...

433
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:20,547
Let's just... Let's face it, you know,
you were dealt a shit hand.

434
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:22,632
But...

435
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:24,718
...sometimes your luck can change.

436
00:30:24,926 --> 00:30:26,011
I mean...

437
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:29,890
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
I was... I started with a shit hand...

438
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:33,769
...and I ended up with a, you know,
a full house. Okay?

439
00:30:34,186 --> 00:30:36,313
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

440
00:30:36,521 --> 00:30:40,567
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets,
keep placing your bets.

441
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:43,820
Hank...

442
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:46,990
...what the hell are you saying?
- Please, Marie, let him talk.

443
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:50,327
That's what we're here to do. Please.

444
00:30:51,244 --> 00:30:53,079
Go on, Hank.

445
00:30:53,997 --> 00:30:58,168
All right, look at it this way, okay?

446
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:01,338
It's the bottom of the ninth,
bases are loaded...

447
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:03,090
...you're up.

448
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:06,009
But you got a bum arm, right?

449
00:31:06,218 --> 00:31:09,429
There's no fricking way
you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

450
00:31:09,638 --> 00:31:13,308
So you can either let the pinch hitter
take the bat...

451
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:17,479
...or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

452
00:31:17,854 --> 00:31:19,815
You get what I'm saying?

453
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:22,901
No.

454
00:31:25,153 --> 00:31:27,864
You got your pride, man.
I get it, okay? I get it.

455
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:30,826
But this Daddy Warbucks
wants to chip in, man.

456
00:31:31,034 --> 00:31:35,247
I'm with your old lady on this one.
I say take the money and run, man.

457
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,669
Somebody wanna take this thing?
Here.

458
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:42,212
Yes, Walter...

459
00:31:42,421 --> 00:31:48,176
Walter, Jr., I'm sure that you have
about a million things to say, probably.

460
00:31:48,385 --> 00:31:50,846
And now is your chance.

461
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,308
Go ahead. Just let it all out.

462
00:31:57,853 --> 00:31:59,020
This is bullshit.

463
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:01,064
- All right, come on.
- It's all right.

464
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,150
It...

465
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:07,821
Talk.

466
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:10,532
Tell your dad how you feel.

467
00:32:13,452 --> 00:32:16,246
- I'm pissed off.
- Tell him.

468
00:32:16,997 --> 00:32:19,624
I'm pissed off.

469
00:32:19,833 --> 00:32:22,419
Because you're being...

470
00:32:23,086 --> 00:32:24,379
You're...

471
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,091
You're a pussy.

472
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:33,430
You're, like, ready to give up.

473
00:32:35,682 --> 00:32:39,186
You're... God.

474
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:41,855
What if you gave up on me, huh?

475
00:32:47,903 --> 00:32:49,654
This here...

476
00:32:49,863 --> 00:32:51,865
...all the stuff I've been through...

477
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:56,369
...and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

478
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:13,512
Me, personally...

479
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:18,058
...I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

480
00:33:20,018 --> 00:33:21,520
What?

481
00:33:22,354 --> 00:33:24,731
You told us to be honest
about our feelings.

482
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,067
Walt's the one with cancer,
it's his decision.

483
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:29,236
It's not up to any of us.

484
00:33:29,444 --> 00:33:33,907
- Why in hell would you do this?
- Hey, hey.

485
00:33:34,116 --> 00:33:37,244
I wasn't planning
on agreeing with Walt.

486
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:40,497
After sitting and listening
to you all talk about his future...

487
00:33:40,705 --> 00:33:44,084
...like he has no say in it...
- He's not gonna have a future...

488
00:33:44,292 --> 00:33:45,961
...if he doesn't get treatment.

489
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,172
I am a medical professional.

490
00:33:49,381 --> 00:33:53,301
I x-ray people in treatment
every day.

491
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:56,012
I see them every day.
And you know what?

492
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:59,975
Some of them
are absolutely miserable.

493
00:34:00,183 --> 00:34:02,811
- Marie...
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

494
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:07,649
And some of them don't wanna spend
their last weeks or months...

495
00:34:07,858 --> 00:34:10,318
...being picked at by doctors.

496
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:12,946
But they got talked into it
by their families.

497
00:34:13,155 --> 00:34:15,282
Can I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie.

498
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,491
- Thank you.
- Hank...

499
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,869
What? Maybe Walt wants to die
like a man.

500
00:34:19,077 --> 00:34:21,496
I don't want him to die at all.

501
00:34:21,705 --> 00:34:24,958
That's the whole point of this.
So either help or leave.

502
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,253
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy...

503
00:34:28,462 --> 00:34:30,714
...of giving you my honest opinion.

504
00:34:30,922 --> 00:34:34,551
You know, Marie,
this is not debate club.

505
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:40,098
- This is my husband's life...
- I made one simple observation...

506
00:34:40,307 --> 00:34:43,852
- And it's like you... How dare you...
- Okay, so we disagree...

507
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,062
Ladies! Marie!

508
00:34:48,356 --> 00:34:50,776
This is so stupid.

509
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:57,365
All right,
I've got the talking pillow now.

510
00:34:58,825 --> 00:35:00,035
Okay?

511
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:13,757
We all, in this room...

512
00:35:14,174 --> 00:35:16,218
...we love each other.

513
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:20,138
We want what's best for each other,
and I know that.

514
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:23,058
I am very thankful for that.

515
00:35:24,434 --> 00:35:27,854
But what I want...

516
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,735
What I want, what I need...

517
00:35:35,195 --> 00:35:37,697
...is a choice.

518
00:35:38,365 --> 00:35:42,369
What does that mean?

519
00:35:44,204 --> 00:35:49,251
Sometimes I feel like I never
actually...

520
00:35:49,459 --> 00:35:53,088
...make any of my own choices...

521
00:35:53,296 --> 00:35:55,048
...I mean.

522
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:02,514
My entire life...

523
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,268
...it just seems I never...

524
00:36:09,312 --> 00:36:13,692
...you know, had a real say
about any of it.

525
00:36:16,695 --> 00:36:19,990
Now, this last one, cancer...

526
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:26,037
...all I have left is
how I choose to approach this.

527
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:29,207
Then make the right choice, Walt.

528
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:32,961
You are not the only one it affects.

529
00:36:33,962 --> 00:36:35,589
What about your son?

530
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:41,470
Don't you wanna see your daughter
grow up? I just...

531
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:48,560
Of course I do.

532
00:36:50,437 --> 00:36:55,108
Skyler, you've read the statistics,
you...

533
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:01,907
These doctors...

534
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:05,076
...talking about "surviving"...

535
00:37:05,285 --> 00:37:09,790
...one year, two years,
like it's the only thing that matters.

536
00:37:09,998 --> 00:37:17,005
But what good is it to just survive
if I am too sick to work?

537
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:20,675
To enjoy a meal?

538
00:37:22,761 --> 00:37:24,596
To make love?

539
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,356
For what time I have left...

540
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,902
...I wanna live in my own house.

541
00:37:39,111 --> 00:37:41,905
I wanna sleep in my own bed.

542
00:37:42,114 --> 00:37:45,659
I don't wanna choke down
30 or 40 pills every single day...

543
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:47,077
...and lose my hair...

544
00:37:47,661 --> 00:37:51,998
...and lie around,
too tired to get up...

545
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:58,171
...and so nauseated
that I can't even move my head.

546
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:02,050
And you.

547
00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:04,928
Cleaning up after me.

548
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,182
And me? What...?

549
00:38:09,933 --> 00:38:11,852
Some...

550
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:16,731
Some dead man,
some artificially-alive...

551
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:20,652
Just marking time.

552
00:38:22,195 --> 00:38:24,364
No. No.

553
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:30,996
And that's
how you would remember me.

554
00:38:37,043 --> 00:38:39,379
That's the worst part.

555
00:38:42,382 --> 00:38:48,388
So that is my thought process,
Skyler.

556
00:38:50,015 --> 00:38:52,726
I'm sorry. I just...

557
00:38:56,897 --> 00:39:00,233
I choose not to do it.

558
00:40:54,723 --> 00:40:56,475
All right.

559
00:40:59,728 --> 00:41:01,897
"All right" what?

560
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:07,611
I'll do the treatment.

561
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,936
It's gonna be okay.

562
00:41:41,436 --> 00:41:43,271
Okay.

563
00:42:08,922 --> 00:42:10,549
The lady from the billing office...

564
00:42:10,757 --> 00:42:13,677
...said they usually bill
the insurance company directly.

565
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:19,057
But since our HMO's not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

566
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:21,143
Good.

567
00:42:21,685 --> 00:42:26,231
Oh, and then Elliott
will send a cheque.

568
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,151
I will take care of it.

569
00:42:34,156 --> 00:42:35,907
Walter White?

570
00:42:36,408 --> 00:42:38,201
Yes.

571
00:42:40,328 --> 00:42:42,205
Okay.

572
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:44,040
- All right.
- Okay.

573
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:45,542
- See you in a minute.
- Okay.

574
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:47,002
Okay.

575
00:44:18,093 --> 00:44:19,594
Elliott.

576
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:22,180
<i>Walt, it's Gretchen. </i>

577
00:44:23,557 --> 00:44:25,058
Oh, hey.

578
00:44:25,267 --> 00:44:26,935
Hey, Gretchen, how are you?

579
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:30,981
<i>You know, it was really great seeing</i>
<i>you two the other day, you know. </i>

580
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:33,733
Wow, what a party.

581
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,071
Elliott told me about the cancer.

582
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,575
I'm so sorry.

583
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:44,536
<i>Well, you know... </i>

584
00:44:45,162 --> 00:44:47,372
...it is what it is, I guess.

585
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:49,666
<i>I don't know what to say. </i>

586
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:52,878
Except, I'm always here for you.

587
00:44:53,503 --> 00:44:56,923
<i>Both of us are.</i>
<i>We wanted you to know that. </i>

588
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,886
Yeah, well, thank you.

589
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,225
<i>Walt, Elliott told me that he'd offered</i>
<i>to pay for the treatment. </i>

590
00:45:07,434 --> 00:45:08,518
<i>You have to accept. </i>

591
00:45:08,727 --> 00:45:10,854
That money,
as far as we're both concerned...

592
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:13,315
...that belongs to you.

593
00:45:13,523 --> 00:45:17,068
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

594
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:20,739
<i>Walt?</i>

595
00:45:23,784 --> 00:45:26,787
Is this about you and me?

596
00:45:39,007 --> 00:45:41,384
Gretchen, I really appreciate
the offer.

597
00:45:41,593 --> 00:45:45,097
<i>I do. But we're fine.</i>

598
00:45:46,264 --> 00:45:49,726
As it turns out,
the insurance came through after all.

599
00:45:49,935 --> 00:45:51,812
So...

600
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:55,440
...I am covered. And...

601
00:45:55,816 --> 00:45:58,568
<i>Well, and, anyway,</i>
<i>I really appreciate it, I really do. </i>

602
00:45:58,777 --> 00:46:00,529
<i>Thank you. </i>

603
00:46:01,404 --> 00:46:03,907
Good. That's good news.

604
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:08,620
You know,
that really was a great party.

605
00:46:11,706 --> 00:46:16,336
- Keep in touch, okay?
- Sure. Sure, and...

606
00:46:16,545 --> 00:46:18,797
...thank you for calling.

607
00:47:07,554 --> 00:47:08,722
Yo!

608
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:19,024
Wanna cook?

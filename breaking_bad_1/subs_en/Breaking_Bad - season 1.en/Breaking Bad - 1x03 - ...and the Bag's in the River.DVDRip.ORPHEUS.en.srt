1
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,523
<i>Let's break it down. </i>

2
00:00:49,692 --> 00:00:51,985
Hydrogen. What does that give us?

3
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:54,988
By mole, we're looking at 63 percent.

4
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:57,282
Sixty-three?

5
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,909
That is a big bite.

6
00:00:59,118 --> 00:01:02,246
- My next step's gotta be oxygen.
- Oxygen, 26 percent.

7
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:04,623
Twenty-six.
There you have your water.

8
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:08,210
- Carbon, 9 percent.
- Carbon, 9.

9
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:11,338
- For a total of 98 percent.
- Right.

10
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:15,801
- Nitrogen, 1.25 percent.
- One-point-two-five.

11
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,303
That brings you to 99 and a quarter.

12
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,473
Which only leaves you
with the trace elements...

13
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:24,226
...down where the magic happens.

14
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:28,188
Oh, wait a minute. What about calcium?
Calcium's not a trace.

15
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:30,190
Got a whole skeleton to account for.

16
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:32,067
- You would think, right?
- Right.

17
00:01:32,276 --> 00:01:35,821
Calcium.
Calcium's only 0.25 percent.

18
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:40,743
What? That low? Seriously?

19
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,661
Damn, I never would've thought that.

20
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,666
- Okay, so where does iron fit in?
- Iron.

21
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:54,715
Well, okay, 0.00004 percent.

22
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,802
What? You can't have
haemoglobin without iron.

23
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:01,847
- Apparently, it don't take much.
- No doubt. Go figure.

24
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,893
- Sodium.
- Sodium, 0.04.

25
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:12,816
- Phosphorus, 0.19.
- Point-one-nine.

26
00:02:13,525 --> 00:02:14,943
There we go.

27
00:02:15,444 --> 00:02:18,947
So the whole thing...

28
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:25,579
...adds up to 99.888042 percent.

29
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,629
We are 0.111958 percent...

30
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,964
...shy.

31
00:02:36,173 --> 00:02:39,802
- Supposedly, that's everything.
- Yeah?

32
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,971
I don't know, I just...

33
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,725
It seems like something's missing,
doesn't it?

34
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,981
There's got to be more
to a human being than that.

35
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,056
I hate these shoes.

36
00:03:26,265 --> 00:03:28,976
Shoes make me look like
I should be changing bedpans...

37
00:03:29,184 --> 00:03:31,020
...like I should be squeaking around...

38
00:03:31,228 --> 00:03:33,814
...bringing soup to some
disgusting old person...

39
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:35,983
...then take the bus home
to my 16 cats.

40
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:38,402
Then why are you wearing them?

41
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:42,906
I like the support. My arches
happen to be extremely archy.

42
00:03:46,076 --> 00:03:51,707
Yo, what's up? Hey, can you call me,
like, in two minutes? Thanks, bye.

43
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,794
I gotta go take this.

44
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,505
Female?

45
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,759
Louis.

46
00:04:01,967 --> 00:04:05,429
Not like it's any
of your business, though.

47
00:04:05,637 --> 00:04:07,598
- Just be quick about it.
- No.

48
00:04:07,806 --> 00:04:12,186
Oh, and please don't say, "Yo. "

49
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:15,147
You can't know how much I hate that.

50
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,947
You missed a spot, right there.

51
00:04:24,448 --> 00:04:25,824
Should you be on that ladder?

52
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:28,494
You're more than welcome
to take over for me in here.

53
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,913
I don't see why you don't get
Walt to do it.

54
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:34,333
Yeah, there's an idea.

55
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,338
So I'm working on
this new short story...

56
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:44,134
...and there's this stoner character in it
and I'm trying to...

57
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:47,554
Well, you know, actually,
let me back up.

58
00:04:47,763 --> 00:04:53,310
You smoked your fair share of pot
in college, didn't you?

59
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:58,065
I mean, you at least tried it.

60
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:01,985
Come on.

61
00:05:03,946 --> 00:05:07,991
I perhaps tried it. Why?

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,494
Do you remember it
having an effect on your mood?

63
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:12,788
Like, changing it in any major way?

64
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,624
It made me more serious.

65
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,501
Really?

66
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:23,006
Because I mostly remember it made me
light-headed, that's about it.

67
00:05:23,799 --> 00:05:27,970
I was just wondering
if it maybe could...

68
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,310
You know, it's just a character thing
I'm stuck on. Never mind.

69
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,605
- Walter Jr. 's on pot?
- What? No.

70
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:40,482
No. No.

71
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,235
- What would make you even...?
- Where's he getting it?

72
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:46,905
- Marie.
- Seriously. Is it this Louis person?

73
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:51,452
- What are you gonna do about this?
- Marie, you need to look me in the eye.

74
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,539
I am strictly asking about a story
that I'm writing, that's all.

75
00:05:56,165 --> 00:06:00,294
Right hand to God,
Walter Jr. Is not on pot...

76
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:03,338
...certainly not as far as I know.

77
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,008
Not as far as you know?

78
00:06:06,508 --> 00:06:08,093
Marie.

79
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,119
Hey, look at me.

80
00:07:58,787 --> 00:08:00,914
Hey, turn around and look at me.

81
00:08:05,627 --> 00:08:09,339
This here.

82
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:12,509
I wouldn't do this
to my worst enemy.

83
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:16,472
This is degrading.

84
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:22,895
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:23,812 --> 00:08:26,940
You hope I'll make it easy
and just drop dead, don't you?

86
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:30,235
But I won't.

87
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,863
So either kill me, or let me go.

88
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:36,658
You don't have it in you, Walter.

89
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:42,456
How do you know my name?

90
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:48,045
Jesse. He told Emilio and me.

91
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:51,340
I came by to sell your meth.

92
00:08:52,758 --> 00:08:56,011
So what? You threaten him, huh?
Did you beat it out of him?

93
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,222
Not even close.

94
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,977
What else did he tell you?

95
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,107
Pretty much everything
he could think of.

96
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:10,567
You were his high school teacher.

97
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,778
One time you taught
about carbon dioxide...

98
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,531
...by making grape soda in class.

99
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,993
You have a son who's retarded,
or in a wheelchair or something.

100
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,457
It shouldn't come across
as some news flash.

101
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:27,835
That partner of yours...

102
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:29,169
...he's got a big mouth.

103
00:09:31,046 --> 00:09:32,715
Walter...

104
00:09:32,923 --> 00:09:35,384
...I don't know what you think
you're doing here...

105
00:09:35,592 --> 00:09:37,261
...but trust me...

106
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:40,597
...this line of work doesn't suit you.

107
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,936
So I should just let you go, then.

108
00:09:46,145 --> 00:09:50,649
Just unlock you and... adiós, huh?

109
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,610
I don't see
what other choice you have.

110
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,655
It's between that
and cold-blooded murder.

111
00:09:57,448 --> 00:09:58,907
Besides...

112
00:10:00,117 --> 00:10:02,077
...your real problem's
sitting upstairs.

113
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:23,140
Occupied.

114
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:26,352
Hey, yo, I'm trying to pinch one off
in here.

115
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,604
Just give me some privacy,
would you?

116
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,526
- Okay.
- What the hell, man?

117
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:37,404
What are you doing, man?

118
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,865
- You asshole. What...?
- You told him my name.

119
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,159
- Says who, him?
- My name, where I work.

120
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:44,745
- You told him about my son.
- Hey, don't touch me.

121
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:47,539
- You damn junkie.
- No, give me that. That's mine.

122
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:49,875
This is going down the toilet.
Watch it go.

123
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,585
No, that's worth 40 grand, you...

124
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:54,505
It's worth nothing
when you smoke it all.

125
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:56,673
Get off the toilet.

126
00:10:56,882 --> 00:10:58,675
- Get off the toilet!
- No.

127
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,806
Get off the toilet.

128
00:11:04,139 --> 00:11:06,266
Stop it.

129
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,021
No. No way.

130
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:46,807
No.

131
00:11:47,016 --> 00:11:48,976
No, no, no.

132
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:51,729
Jesse, where the hell do you think
you're going?

133
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,272
Back off, man, Jesus.

134
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,940
- We've got work to do.
- No, no.

135
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,651
You got work to do. I did my part.

136
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,320
You mean that obscenity
I spent hours cleaning up?

137
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:03,407
- That is your contribution?
- Kiss my pink ass, man.

138
00:12:03,615 --> 00:12:06,910
I didn't ask for any of this. How am I
supposed to live here now, huh?

139
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:09,705
My whole house smells like
toe cheese and dry cleaning.

140
00:12:09,913 --> 00:12:13,000
Because you didn't follow
my instructions.

141
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:14,918
Oh, well, <i>Heil</i> Hitler, bitch.

142
00:12:15,127 --> 00:12:17,379
And let me tell you something else.

143
00:12:17,588 --> 00:12:20,382
We flipped a coin, okay?

144
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:23,135
You and me. You and me.

145
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,637
Coin flip is sacred.

146
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:38,442
Your job is waiting for you
in that basement...

147
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,861
...as per the coin.

148
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,571
Fucking do it, already.

149
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:00,506
That's what she said. Yeah.

150
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,884
Yeah. Yeah, I think
we have some of those.

151
00:13:04,593 --> 00:13:06,553
- Yeah, you'll have to try them on.
- Hello?

152
00:13:06,762 --> 00:13:09,223
- Seven and a half, maybe. I don't know.
- Excuse me.

153
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:10,849
Do you have these in black?

154
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:15,020
Anyways, so like I was saying...

155
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:18,565
...I went to the party the other night.
Yeah, Tony was there.

156
00:13:22,403 --> 00:13:23,696
Whatever.

157
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:26,532
Hey, where have you been?
I called you two hours ago.

158
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,201
<i>Sorry, baby, I'm kind of busy here.</i>
<i>What's up?</i>

159
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,622
Well, kind of a lot, actually,
and it's a delicate subject.

160
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:38,669
- So I need you to focus, and...
<i>- Hey, sit down! Sit down!</i>

161
00:13:38,877 --> 00:13:40,963
Damn it, Hank.

162
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,924
I'm sorry, babe, I'm just in the middle
of something here.

163
00:13:44,133 --> 00:13:45,968
Get down. Get down.

164
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:49,888
Sit down! Sit your ass down,
<i>comprende?</i> You too, sit down!

165
00:13:55,227 --> 00:13:57,354
I'm back, babe. What's up?

166
00:13:57,563 --> 00:14:00,899
- Walter Jr.
<i>- Yeah, what about him?</i>

167
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:04,695
Marijuana. He's smoking it.

168
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,072
<i>Excuse me, his own mother</i>
<i>seems to think so. </i>

169
00:14:07,281 --> 00:14:09,199
- Skyler told you that?
<i>- She inferred it. </i>

170
00:14:09,408 --> 00:14:10,701
She inferred it, huh?

171
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:13,704
She strongly inferred it.

172
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:19,460
Like, " Doctor, my friend suffers
from erectile dysfunction. "

173
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:21,211
<i>- Please, come on. </i>
- All right.

174
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,547
- Talk to him.
<i>- Walt should talk to him. </i>

175
00:14:23,756 --> 00:14:25,716
Skyler, better yet.
She'll kick his butt.

176
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:28,010
<i>I think it ought to be you. </i>

177
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,220
You know, tell him
some horror stories.

178
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:33,140
Maybe show him
some autopsy pictures.

179
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,184
An autopsy of a pot overdose?
Come on.

180
00:14:35,517 --> 00:14:37,728
I don't know, baby,
it's just that, you know...

181
00:14:37,936 --> 00:14:41,106
...I figure his dad should be the one
doing this, don't you think?

182
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:43,567
Hank, he respects you.

183
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:50,824
Yeah, all right. Well, listen, yeah,
I'll swing by their place after work.

184
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,744
- Good. Scare him straight.
<i>- Yeah, yeah. </i>

185
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,537
Hey, where's my sugar?

186
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,002
Excuse me, ma'am.

187
00:15:02,461 --> 00:15:05,422
Ma'am, you need to be wearing footies
before you try those on.

188
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:07,549
I'm extremely clean.

189
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:10,761
Yeah, well, I'd really appreciate it.

190
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:15,724
Hey, sorry about that.
Yeah, I'll check.

191
00:15:16,684 --> 00:15:19,144
You know, I hid a pair for you
last week, grey ones.

192
00:16:10,154 --> 00:16:13,323
- What do you think?
- About what?

193
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:15,826
This look like a nice place?

194
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,829
No, not really.

195
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,040
Think you'd like to live here?

196
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,042
No.

197
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,128
- Sure about that?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

198
00:16:26,336 --> 00:16:29,423
I thought we were going to
Cold Stone Creamery.

199
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:32,176
Yeah, yeah, well,
we took a little detour.

200
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:35,429
Figure we'll come over
and check out how the other half lives.

201
00:16:35,637 --> 00:16:38,140
This here is what we call
the Crystal Palace.

202
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:41,101
You know who lives in the palace?
Meth-heads.

203
00:16:41,852 --> 00:16:44,104
Nasty, skeevy meth-heads...

204
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:48,275
...who'd sell their grandma's coochie
for a hit.

205
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,944
Oh, you think that's funny?
That's funny, huh? Yeah.

206
00:16:51,153 --> 00:16:53,447
Let me tell you something.
Every one of these...

207
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:57,951
...miserable wastes of skin
got started how?

208
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,371
- How do you think they started?
- I don't know.

209
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,374
What do you think they were doing
before they graduated...

210
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:06,251
...to shooting meth in their dicks?

211
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,713
A gateway drug.

212
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,632
That's what we call it.

213
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,176
Dollars to doughnuts,
and I shit you not...

214
00:17:14,385 --> 00:17:18,263
...that gateway drug was marijuana,
every time.

215
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,474
- You understand?
- Yeah.

216
00:17:20,683 --> 00:17:23,727
So why are you telling me this?

217
00:17:23,936 --> 00:17:26,563
Because I love you,
you little bastard.

218
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,858
And, hey, I was young once,
you know.

219
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,654
The world's a messed up place,
you know.

220
00:17:33,862 --> 00:17:37,199
You know, just this one time,
you know...

221
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:40,411
Hey! Hey! Hey, you!

222
00:17:40,619 --> 00:17:44,498
Yeah, you, princess. Get over here.

223
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,712
Hey, don't make me
get out of the car.

224
00:17:54,133 --> 00:17:55,426
Check this out.

225
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,678
What I'm talking about.

226
00:17:58,762 --> 00:18:01,181
- I ain't holding, okay?
- Did I say open your mouth?

227
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,267
And hands off the car.

228
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:07,354
Other side. Go around the other side,
talk to my friend here.

229
00:18:10,274 --> 00:18:12,401
What's your name, sweetheart?

230
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:15,404
- Wendy.
- Wendy, huh?

231
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,740
How much you charge
for a windy, Wendy?

232
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,160
- I ain't doing him, he's a kid.
- Jesus, was that my question?

233
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,121
Don't think so hard,
it's gonna hurt your brain.

234
00:18:24,329 --> 00:18:27,207
- Are you on the pipe or on the needle?
- Nothing. Neither.

235
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,585
Yeah, yeah.
Show us your teeth, huh?

236
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,671
Come on, Wendy,
let's see those pearly whites.

237
00:18:34,465 --> 00:18:38,344
Oh, God. See that? Pipe, definitely.

238
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,179
Big time, big time on the pipe.

239
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:42,473
You got something
you wanna ask Wendy?

240
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:44,266
No, not really.

241
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:46,602
You ever smoke anything else,
Wendy?

242
00:18:47,102 --> 00:18:49,355
Sausages don't count.

243
00:18:50,773 --> 00:18:53,942
Seriously, tell my friend here
how you got started.

244
00:18:54,151 --> 00:18:57,946
Probably used to be, what? Like a
Girl Scout, or sang in the church choir.

245
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:02,201
- What are you, like, handicapped?
- He broke his leg playing football.

246
00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,080
He's a qb. Got an arm like a howitzer.

247
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:10,292
So tell me, Wendy, you smoke pot?

248
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:11,627
Why, you got some?

249
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:14,463
No. Right, hoof it, get lost.
Get out of here.

250
00:19:14,671 --> 00:19:17,925
Hey, fair warning, next time
I'm gonna bust you.

251
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,725
So, what do you think?

252
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:29,978
Cool.

253
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:42,950
Shut the door. Shut the door.
Lock it. Lock it, lock it.

254
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:44,993
Who the hell was that?

255
00:19:45,202 --> 00:19:47,955
Cop and some football player
messing with me.

256
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:50,416
They ask about me, huh?

257
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,127
No, I think they just wanted pot.

258
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,726
Right there.

259
00:20:10,144 --> 00:20:12,438
Shit, I left my root beer.

260
00:21:01,653 --> 00:21:04,698
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hey, sweetie, it's me.

261
00:21:04,907 --> 00:21:06,700
Listen, I'm so sorry.

262
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:12,122
Time, it just completely got away
from me. I'm just...

263
00:21:13,332 --> 00:21:17,086
My fault, my fault.
Bogdan just kept me here late...

264
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:19,880
...you know, doing some inventory...

265
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:22,675
...and I should've just...

266
00:21:22,883 --> 00:21:28,013
You know, you're right.
I gotta learn to say, you know, "No. "

267
00:21:28,222 --> 00:21:30,224
But...

268
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,019
Sky? You there?

269
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:37,523
<i>You're at the car wash?</i>

270
00:21:38,482 --> 00:21:40,109
Yeah.

271
00:21:40,901 --> 00:21:45,906
I seriously doubt that,
since you quit two weeks ago.

272
00:21:51,578 --> 00:21:55,416
I called Bogdan, looking for you.

273
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,043
Quite an earful he gave me.

274
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,922
Listen...

275
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,801
Listen, I'll come home
and we'll talk about it.

276
00:22:07,344 --> 00:22:09,805
- I don't think so, Walt.
<i>- Honey... </i>

277
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:12,016
Wherever you are...

278
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,894
...why don't you just
stay there tonight?

279
00:22:20,566 --> 00:22:21,984
Skyler?

280
00:22:23,777 --> 00:22:25,779
<i>Walter?</i>

281
00:22:26,155 --> 00:22:27,614
Hello?

282
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:30,617
Hey, there's a hungry guy here.

283
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:10,884
Come on.

284
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:34,950
Damn.

285
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:37,828
I didn't think you were coming back.

286
00:24:52,176 --> 00:24:53,761
How long was I out?

287
00:24:55,012 --> 00:24:56,680
Ten, 15 minutes?

288
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:02,311
I've never seen someone knock
themselves out just by coughing.

289
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:04,563
Were you on the same shit
you used on me?

290
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:14,948
I've got lung cancer.

291
00:25:39,765 --> 00:25:42,226
I'll make you another sandwich.

292
00:26:19,138 --> 00:26:20,931
It's safe.

293
00:26:21,932 --> 00:26:23,934
There's no poison.

294
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:29,231
Because that would be
the way to do it...

295
00:26:29,982 --> 00:26:31,984
...if you're gonna do it.

296
00:26:33,277 --> 00:26:35,487
I suppose it would.

297
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:39,867
You being a chemist and all.

298
00:26:57,051 --> 00:27:00,971
So that name...

299
00:27:01,388 --> 00:27:03,557
...Krazy-8.

300
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,976
Do I really have to call you that?

301
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:08,771
I mean, no offence, but...

302
00:27:09,313 --> 00:27:11,273
...don't you have a real name?

303
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:14,276
Domingo.

304
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:17,029
Domingo.

305
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:19,990
That's "Sunday," right?

306
00:27:22,493 --> 00:27:26,330
I'd rather call you that,
if you don't mind.

307
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,668
I can't say I ever liked it much.

308
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:37,883
So, Domingo...

309
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:41,929
...you from around town here
or someplace else?

310
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:44,306
Hey, Walter?
You getting to know me...

311
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:47,559
...is not gonna make it easier
for you to kill me.

312
00:27:48,102 --> 00:27:49,853
Not that I mind, you understand?

313
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:55,943
You know, you keep telling me
that I don't have it in me.

314
00:27:56,151 --> 00:27:57,820
Well, maybe.

315
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,197
But maybe not.

316
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:06,078
I sure as hell am looking for
any reason not to.

317
00:28:06,286 --> 00:28:09,707
I mean, any good reason at all.

318
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:17,965
Sell me.

319
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:20,217
Tell me what it is.

320
00:28:23,846 --> 00:28:26,265
I'd start off by promising
that if you let me go...

321
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:29,810
...I won't come after you,
that you'd be safe.

322
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:32,021
I guess I'd say
what happened between us...

323
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:34,356
...never happened.

324
00:28:34,565 --> 00:28:38,235
And what's best for both parties
is we forget all about it.

325
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:42,614
But you know anybody in my situation
would make promises like that.

326
00:28:42,823 --> 00:28:45,200
And, in my case,
they happen to be true.

327
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:46,869
You'll never know for sure.

328
00:28:50,914 --> 00:28:53,083
So, what else can I tell you?

329
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:00,841
I don't know.

330
00:29:02,217 --> 00:29:04,762
But you've gotta convince me.

331
00:29:05,637 --> 00:29:09,558
And you're going nowhere
until you do.

332
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:13,103
- Hey, yeah.
- Yeah.

333
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:15,564
I'm from here in town, man.

334
00:29:16,357 --> 00:29:18,901
ABQ, born and bred.

335
00:29:19,109 --> 00:29:21,028
Never left.

336
00:29:21,653 --> 00:29:24,907
Studied Business Administration
over at UNM...

337
00:29:25,115 --> 00:29:26,325
...got my degree.

338
00:29:27,576 --> 00:29:29,244
Really?

339
00:29:31,872 --> 00:29:35,417
Does that come in handy
in the drug trade?

340
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,419
Doesn't hurt.

341
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:41,006
I was gonna study music originally.

342
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:44,218
Maybe even try out
for Oberlin and Berklee.

343
00:29:44,426 --> 00:29:47,680
My pops talked me out of it.

344
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:51,767
Said there was no money in it unless
I wind up some bullshit rock star...

345
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:54,937
...and I hadn't a snowball chance
at that one.

346
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:58,148
What does your dad do?

347
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:02,486
He owns Tampico Furniture
over on Menaul.

348
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:06,156
Wait a minute, I know that place.

349
00:30:08,701 --> 00:30:10,577
Wait a minute. That's...

350
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:13,163
That's that...

351
00:30:13,372 --> 00:30:15,749
They used to have those late-night...

352
00:30:15,958 --> 00:30:18,210
- The stupid commercials.
- That they had, yeah.

353
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:21,547
Yeah, that's him.
Been doing them for over 30 years.

354
00:30:21,755 --> 00:30:25,426
Wait a minute.
How did it go? It was...

355
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,470
Wait, wait, wait. It was...

356
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,226
<i>Don't let shopping</i>
<i>Strain your brain-o</i>

357
00:30:34,518 --> 00:30:38,147
<i>Just sing this short refrain-o</i>

358
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:41,525
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno
<i>- Our furniture is</i> bueno

359
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:45,320
<i>- Tampico is the name- o</i>
<i>- Tampico is the name- o</i>

360
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:58,917
Pretty moronic. But what can you do?

361
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:02,838
Well, it did tend
to stick in your head.

362
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:06,800
Did you write that?
Being the musician in the family.

363
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:10,971
Oh, no, man.
It was my crazy uncle Alex.

364
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,432
He sings it at bars,
trying to pick up on women.

365
00:31:15,017 --> 00:31:18,979
His mind, it's like saying,
"Hey, I wrote 'Stairway to Heaven. "'

366
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:24,193
Yeah, but at Tampico Furniture, I...

367
00:31:24,735 --> 00:31:29,573
I think when my son was born
that we bought his bassinet there.

368
00:31:29,782 --> 00:31:32,951
We don't sell bassinets there.
It's more of a speciality item.

369
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,370
We did use to sell cribs.

370
00:31:36,622 --> 00:31:39,166
A crib, then, okay. A crib.

371
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:41,502
Yeah. No, I remember that.

372
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:47,758
In fact, I remember recognising
your dad from those commercials.

373
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:51,387
Although, he wasn't anywhere near
as friendly in real life.

374
00:31:51,595 --> 00:31:53,514
Yeah. No shit.

375
00:31:53,722 --> 00:31:56,225
Did he try selling you
that extended warranty?

376
00:31:56,725 --> 00:31:58,686
Yeah, he probably did.

377
00:31:58,894 --> 00:32:01,271
And I was probably dumb enough
to buy it.

378
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,399
Yeah, that was his big thing.

379
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:05,234
You ask him for a glass of water...

380
00:32:05,442 --> 00:32:08,404
...he'd tell you you need
an extended warranty on the ice.

381
00:32:12,408 --> 00:32:14,827
- Did you work there too?
- Only my whole life.

382
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,955
Up until the day I said,
"Fuck you," and quit.

383
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,044
So...

384
00:32:25,838 --> 00:32:28,590
...16 years ago,
how old would you have been?

385
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:32,928
If it was after school,
trust me, I was there.

386
00:32:33,178 --> 00:32:35,180
Might have even helped ring you up.

387
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:39,101
You and your extended warranty
on the crib.

388
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,778
Small world.

389
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:53,032
It is.

390
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:56,994
The paths we take, huh?

391
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:24,980
Jesse know you've got cancer?

392
00:33:27,941 --> 00:33:29,985
No one but you.

393
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:34,239
- Not your family?
- No.

394
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,659
Why not?

395
00:33:41,413 --> 00:33:46,293
Not a conversation
that I'm even remotely ready to have.

396
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:50,631
That's why you're cooking meth?

397
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:53,926
You wanna leave money
for your family.

398
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:57,680
Hell.

399
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,683
I'll write you a cheque right now
if you let me go.

400
00:34:06,313 --> 00:34:08,565
Like I said, Walter...

401
00:34:09,233 --> 00:34:12,152
...if this line of work
doesn't suit you...

402
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:19,159
...get out before it's too late.

403
00:34:25,457 --> 00:34:27,960
I don't know what to do.

404
00:34:38,178 --> 00:34:39,346
You do.

405
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:00,701
I'll get the key.

406
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:44,346
No.

407
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:46,473
No.

408
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:49,351
Oh, no, no, no.

409
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:03,449
No. No, don't do this.

410
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:06,910
Don't do this.
Why are you doing this?

411
00:37:07,578 --> 00:37:10,247
Why are you doing this?

412
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,574
You're doing the right thing, Walter.

413
00:37:52,664 --> 00:37:54,541
Do you wanna?

414
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:13,185
So you're not angry?

415
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:17,690
Angry at you?

416
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:22,277
Live and let live, man.

417
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:26,657
That's very understanding.

418
00:38:26,865 --> 00:38:28,701
Whatever, man.

419
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:31,036
I just wanna go home.

420
00:38:36,959 --> 00:38:38,711
Me too.

421
00:38:46,552 --> 00:38:48,595
Unlock me, Walter.

422
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:06,488
The moment I do...

423
00:39:08,073 --> 00:39:11,035
...are you gonna stick me
with that broken piece of plate?

424
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:41,648
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

425
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,692
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

426
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:47,696
I'm sorry.

427
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:56,663
I'm sorry.

428
00:39:56,955 --> 00:39:59,166
I'm so sorry.

429
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:29,798
Hello?

430
00:41:30,799 --> 00:41:33,135
Anybody down here?

431
00:42:40,536 --> 00:42:42,621
Everybody...

432
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,208
...I need you all to take your seats.

433
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:49,211
Settle down, please. Thank you.

434
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,172
I understand
that Mr. White is feeling...

435
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:54,967
...a little under the weather
this morning.

436
00:42:55,175 --> 00:43:00,139
So you folks are going to have
to be making do with me today.

437
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:04,601
And we are going to be watching
a very interesting video...

438
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,272
...on carbon.

439
00:43:08,522 --> 00:43:09,732
Very important stuff.

440
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:16,822
- So, what do you think?
- It's a cook site. Gotta be.

441
00:43:17,031 --> 00:43:20,284
Nobody came way the hell out here
just to buy.

442
00:43:20,492 --> 00:43:23,245
Fire there could have started
by accident.

443
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:25,956
I don't think that was meant
to destroy evidence.

444
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:30,002
Got a couple of Dooley tracks
headed away, towards the road.

445
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:33,464
So, what, they're in
some sort of camper-slash-lab?

446
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:36,717
They accidentally start a fire
and everybody FOs?

447
00:43:36,925 --> 00:43:38,594
Yeah. Why not?

448
00:43:38,802 --> 00:43:41,889
So why did that little hair-gelled shit
leave his car?

449
00:43:45,225 --> 00:43:50,147
- Gomey, it's a culture in decline.
- It's a rich and vibrant culture.

450
00:43:50,356 --> 00:43:52,608
It's a car that jumps up and down.

451
00:43:53,067 --> 00:43:54,276
What the hell?

452
00:43:54,485 --> 00:43:57,613
You people used to be conquistadors,
for chrissake.

453
00:43:57,821 --> 00:44:01,909
Smells like a Drakkar Noir
factory in here.

454
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:03,869
I already searched it.

455
00:44:04,411 --> 00:44:06,205
Yeah.

456
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,124
You're wasting your time.

457
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,961
Give it up. If this here's a trap car,
it's gonna take more...

458
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:15,839
...than your dumb white ass to find it.
- Oh, yeah?

459
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:20,010
You are talking to the trap-car master,
my friend.

460
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:22,513
I'm Rain Man counting
his toothpicks.

461
00:44:23,013 --> 00:44:25,599
Yeah, you're like Rain Man. Retarded.

462
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:34,650
Yeah, baby.

463
00:44:38,862 --> 00:44:41,407
- Hello, zippy.
- Asshole.

464
00:44:42,282 --> 00:44:46,120
Sort of looks like meth
but it's too damn white.

465
00:44:48,664 --> 00:44:50,416
You know what I'm thinking, Gomey?

466
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:53,335
Yep. Somebody croaked our snitch.

467
00:44:53,544 --> 00:44:55,004
Hey, agent.

468
00:44:55,212 --> 00:44:57,047
You got something?

469
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:33,667
<i>I don't know. </i>

470
00:45:34,668 --> 00:45:37,087
It just... Doesn't it seem like...

471
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:39,923
...something's missing?

472
00:45:40,174 --> 00:45:42,217
What about the soul?

473
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:56,148

1
00:00:52,645 --> 00:00:54,021
Let's get something straight.

2
00:00:54,563 --> 00:00:57,775
This, the chemistry, is my realm.

3
00:00:57,983 --> 00:00:59,818
I am in charge of the cooking.

4
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,821
Out there on the street,
you deal with that.

5
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:09,203
As far as our customers go, I don't
want to know anything about them.

6
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,664
<i>I don't wanna see them,</i>
<i>I don't wanna hear them. </i>

7
00:01:11,872 --> 00:01:15,626
<i>I want no interaction with them</i>
<i>whatsoever. </i>

8
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:22,424
This operation is you and me,
and I'm the silent partner.

9
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:25,094
You got any issues with that?

10
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:27,346
Whatever, man.

11
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:36,021
No matter what happens...

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,273
...no more bloodshed.

13
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:40,859
<i>No violence.</i>

14
00:02:35,181 --> 00:02:36,975
Walt?

15
00:02:37,183 --> 00:02:39,561
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

16
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:41,521
Yeah, I'm okay.

17
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:46,276
You know, honey, you...
You really don't have to...

18
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:50,822
Look, I like being here with you.

19
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:53,283
Yeah.

20
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:56,453
I'm only saying that,
you know, I'd be okay...

21
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:59,122
...that really, if you wanna go...

22
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,711
You know, actually, it would
make me feel a little better...

23
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:08,590
...knowing that you were there
when Walter Jr. Gets home from school.

24
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,262
Okay.

25
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,349
All right.
So you'll call me when you're finished?

26
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:20,268
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

27
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:26,399
Oh, and have you been
in touch with Elliot?

28
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:30,111
Because I haven't seen
a cheque from him.

29
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,238
Yes, I... I got it.

30
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:35,575
- Really?
- It came, yeah. And I...

31
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,410
Yeah, it did. It came last week...

32
00:03:37,619 --> 00:03:40,747
...and I put it right into
my credit union account.

33
00:03:40,955 --> 00:03:44,000
So I'm taking care of it.

34
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,587
- Good.
- Yeah.

35
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,715
So we're good. We're good.

36
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:58,890
Could you not deposit this
until Monday?

37
00:04:01,226 --> 00:04:02,852
Thank you.

38
00:04:03,103 --> 00:04:06,397
Call if the discomfort's too much,
otherwise we'll see you next week.

39
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,192
Yeah.

40
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:34,092
<i>Chemical reactions involve</i>
<i>change on two leveIs:</i>

41
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,761
Matter and energy.

42
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:43,017
When a reaction is gradual,
the change in energy is slight.

43
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:46,563
I mean, you don't even notice
the reaction is happening.

44
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:53,695
For example, when rust collects
on the underside of a car, right?

45
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:01,745
But if a reaction happens quickly...

46
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:05,623
...otherwise harmless substances
can interact in a way...

47
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:10,837
...that generates
enormous bursts of energy.

48
00:05:14,299 --> 00:05:21,097
Who can give me an example
of rapid chemical reaction?

49
00:05:25,477 --> 00:05:27,687
Hint, hint. Right here.

50
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:30,106
Like, an explosion?

51
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,569
Yes, good. Explosions.

52
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:39,240
Explosions are the result
of chemical reactions...

53
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,951
...happening almost instantaneously.

54
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,705
And the faster reactants,
i. e. Explosives...

55
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:49,584
And fulminative mercury
is a prime example of that.

56
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:52,962
The faster they undergo change...

57
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:56,132
...the more violent the explosion.

58
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,930
Explosions.

59
00:06:02,138 --> 00:06:05,225
Okay, listen, why don't you
start reading on your own...

60
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:08,937
...from the top of chapter seven.

61
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,036
You okay?

62
00:06:26,329 --> 00:06:28,456
I got it, Mr. White.

63
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:30,291
Don't worry.

64
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,710
You got kids to teach.

65
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:55,108
Thanks, Hugo.

66
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,621
<i>He's starting to lose weight... </i>

67
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,543
...which is tough, to see that.

68
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:19,799
I can already feel the difference
when I put my arms around him.

69
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:29,642
- Can I talk to...?
- Of course.

70
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,187
Walt.

71
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:35,607
When you don't let me in...

72
00:07:35,815 --> 00:07:38,276
...when you don't tell me
what's going on...

73
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:42,906
I mean, it's like I feel like you don't
even want me around sometimes.

74
00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,240
No.

75
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:48,244
And recently, these afternoons...

76
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,872
...when you're coming home so late...

77
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:55,752
...and we're just left wondering
where you are.

78
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:58,129
Yeah, Dad.

79
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,633
What's up with that?

80
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:09,182
Walt, is there anything else
you're holding back from your family?

81
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,646
Now's the time to share.

82
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:21,653
Well, I...

83
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:26,491
I like to be alone, I mean, at times.

84
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,911
And it's not about you, really.

85
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:34,040
It's just that sometimes
it feels better...

86
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:38,962
...not to talk at all...

87
00:08:40,088 --> 00:08:41,923
...about anything...

88
00:08:42,424 --> 00:08:43,800
...to anyone.

89
00:08:44,342 --> 00:08:47,929
Alone time can be helpful,
for some types.

90
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:53,017
Maybe knowing what you do
when you're alone...

91
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:56,855
...might make it easier for your family
to be more accepting...

92
00:08:57,063 --> 00:09:00,859
...of whatever it is you do alone.

93
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:04,154
Well...

94
00:09:05,739 --> 00:09:09,033
...I like to go on walks...

95
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:14,038
...a couple of times a week,
maybe more, after work.

96
00:09:14,247 --> 00:09:20,211
And I really enjoy the nature.

97
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:23,548
<i>You know, the cacti... </i>

98
00:09:24,758 --> 00:09:28,094
<i>...vegetation, that kind of thing. </i>

99
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:34,517
<i>It's really very therapeutic. </i>

100
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,423
Yo, God, are you okay?

101
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:08,510
- Hey, you did that shit?
- I'm dizzy. No.

102
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:11,429
I'm just dizzy. I need air.

103
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,182
- God, I feel like I'm burning up.
- Sit down, sit down.

104
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,559
I gotta take this off.

105
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,688
Sit down, get some air.

106
00:10:22,565 --> 00:10:24,234
Oh, God.

107
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,486
Here.

108
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:32,534
- Better?
- Yeah, that's better.

109
00:10:39,374 --> 00:10:41,418
When were you gonna tell me?

110
00:10:44,337 --> 00:10:46,131
Tell you what?

111
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:48,341
Cancer.

112
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,593
You got it, right?

113
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,144
How did you know?

114
00:10:59,352 --> 00:11:03,565
My aunt had one of those
dots on her...

115
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:07,569
...to target the radiation.
What, is it in your lung?

116
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm your partner, man,
you should've told me.

117
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:14,868
God, that's not cool, okay?
Not at all.

118
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:18,747
What stage are you?

119
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:22,542
Three-A.

120
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:26,713
Gone into your lymph nodes.

121
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,019
Your aunt...

122
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,856
...how bad was she
when they caught it?

123
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:48,151
Bad enough, she didn't last long.

124
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:53,114
- How long?
- Seven months.

125
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:59,120
God.

126
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:00,955
I get it now.

127
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:03,583
That's why you're doing all this.

128
00:12:03,792 --> 00:12:07,003
You want to make some cash
for your people before you check out.

129
00:12:07,212 --> 00:12:09,172
- You got a problem with that?
- You tell me.

130
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,884
You're the one that looks like
he just crawled out of a microwave.

131
00:12:18,556 --> 00:12:20,767
You gonna be able to
finish the batch?

132
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,102
Yes.

133
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:24,062
All right.

134
00:12:28,233 --> 00:12:29,859
No.

135
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:32,737
You do it.

136
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,950
Me?

137
00:12:37,158 --> 00:12:38,701
Yeah.

138
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,122
What happened to your mad skills?

139
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,505
Go on. Here.

140
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,298
You do it.

141
00:12:55,552 --> 00:12:57,512
You can do it.

142
00:13:02,684 --> 00:13:05,645
If you have any questions,
I'll be right out here.

143
00:13:11,151 --> 00:13:15,447
The next time, put an ice pack
on your head during chemo.

144
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:19,409
My aunt said it helped
with the hair loss.

145
00:13:56,029 --> 00:13:59,157
What's this, Christmas?

146
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:04,913
This that one we found way out
in the boonies at the cook site?

147
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,460
- Holy shit.
- What?

148
00:14:10,668 --> 00:14:13,922
Lab says they pulled up and imprint
of some writing on the inside...

149
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:16,925
...Magic Marker or something.
- Yeah? What's it say?

150
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:20,553
"Property of
J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab. "

151
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,097
That's Walt's school.

152
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:43,970
We were supposed to start at 3.

153
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:47,640
Hey, I'm out there making
fat stacks, man. Chill.

154
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:52,020
Hey, prepaid cell phone. Use it.

155
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:03,448
- How much is this?
- Twenty-six big ones.

156
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,868
Is that all?
Twenty-six-thousand dollars?

157
00:16:07,077 --> 00:16:10,997
No, that's 2600,
and your share is 13...

158
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:14,542
...minus 25 bucks for that phone.

159
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,796
- How much meth did you sell?
- Nearly an ounce.

160
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,176
Last time I checked...

161
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:27,013
...there were 16 ounces to a pound.
What did you do with the rest, smoke it?

162
00:16:27,222 --> 00:16:29,349
Yo, I've been out all night
slinging crystal.

163
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,602
You think it's cake moving
a pound of meth one teenth at a time?

164
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:34,813
Why are you selling it
in small quantities?

165
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:37,607
Why don't you just sell
the whole pound at once?

166
00:16:37,816 --> 00:16:39,734
To who?
What do I look like, Scarface?

167
00:16:39,943 --> 00:16:44,322
This is unacceptable.
I am breaking the law here.

168
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,783
This return is too little for the risk.

169
00:16:46,991 --> 00:16:48,993
I thought you'd be ready
for another pound.

170
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:50,912
You may know a lot
about chemistry...

171
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:53,998
...but you don't know jack
about slinging dope.

172
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:57,335
Well, I'll tell you, I know
a lack of motivation when I see it.

173
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,462
Oh, my...

174
00:16:59,671 --> 00:17:03,466
Come on, you've gotta be more
imaginative, you know, just...

175
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:06,094
Just think outside the box here.

176
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:09,556
We have to move our product in bulk,
wholesale.

177
00:17:09,764 --> 00:17:13,768
Now, how do we do that?

178
00:17:14,894 --> 00:17:18,148
- What do you mean, to a distributor?
- Yes. Yes, that's what we need.

179
00:17:18,356 --> 00:17:21,735
We need a distributor.
Now, do you know anyone like that?

180
00:17:21,943 --> 00:17:25,029
Yeah, I mean, I used to,
until you killed him.

181
00:17:38,918 --> 00:17:42,922
So who took Krazy-8's place?

182
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,675
Some guy named Tuco.

183
00:17:45,884 --> 00:17:47,260
Badass, from what I hear.

184
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:51,890
Tuco, okay.
So then just go talk to Tuco.

185
00:17:52,098 --> 00:17:55,018
Right. Like, " Hello, sir.
Hey, I know you don't know me...

186
00:17:55,226 --> 00:17:58,480
...would you be interested in a
felony quantity of methamphetamine?"

187
00:17:58,688 --> 00:18:01,649
Well, yes, but maybe with
a little more salesmanship, perhaps?

188
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:03,818
You just don't get it, man.
This guy's OG.

189
00:18:04,027 --> 00:18:07,614
- What... What does that mean?
- Jesus, look, he's off our level, man.

190
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:10,909
He's not gonna do business
with some dude he doesn't know.

191
00:18:11,451 --> 00:18:13,244
You don't understand
the way it works.

192
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,539
You can't just bum-rush
some high-level ice man...

193
00:18:16,748 --> 00:18:18,374
...and start cutting deals.

194
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:22,212
Okay? It's risky. You need an intro,
you need someone to vouch.

195
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,339
Well, who introduced you to Krazy-8?

196
00:18:24,547 --> 00:18:27,383
Emilio, and that's only because
I knew him from third grade.

197
00:18:27,592 --> 00:18:31,096
- And we can't talk to Emilio, because...
- All right, all right, all right.

198
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:36,601
Look, I'm telling you,
Mr. White, it's too risky. Okay?

199
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,479
I mean, we're making money.
Why can't you be satisfied...

200
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,773
...with the way it is?
- Oh, come on! Jesus!

201
00:18:41,981 --> 00:18:44,567
Just grow some fucking balls!

202
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,572
- Wait till Monday again?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

203
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,000
Oh, God.

204
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,520
Mr. White.

205
00:20:08,276 --> 00:20:10,278
Thank you, Hugo.

206
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:36,763
- Knock, knock.
- Oh, hey.

207
00:20:37,555 --> 00:20:41,309
- How you feeling, Walt?
- Good. Yeah.

208
00:20:41,935 --> 00:20:44,187
Are you up for having a visitor?

209
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:47,857
- Hey, buddy.
- Hank.

210
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:49,943
Well, let me know
if you need anything.

211
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:52,570
I will. Thank you, Carmen.

212
00:20:54,197 --> 00:20:55,740
Damn.

213
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:59,119
Chick's got an ass like an onion,
makes me wanna cry.

214
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:03,873
So, what... What are you doing here?

215
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:08,253
Well, I had some questions
I wanted to run by you, work-related.

216
00:21:08,461 --> 00:21:10,296
You feeling okay?
I can come back later.

217
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:13,466
No, no, no, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

218
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:17,303
What do you mean,
"work-related," though?

219
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:21,933
Do you recognise that?

220
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,980
No. No.

221
00:21:28,523 --> 00:21:30,150
Well, that was used to cook meth.

222
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:35,447
Found it out on some Indian land
about 40 miles from here.

223
00:21:35,655 --> 00:21:39,409
Old label on the inside used to say:

224
00:21:39,993 --> 00:21:42,620
- "J.P. Winn Chemistry Lab. "
- Really?

225
00:21:43,204 --> 00:21:45,665
I don't understand
how that came from here.

226
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:47,792
I was hoping
you could help me with that.

227
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:51,755
We found it near an abandoned car
that belonged to one of our snitches.

228
00:21:54,507 --> 00:21:55,800
A snitch?

229
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:57,969
Yeah, one of our
confidential informants.

230
00:21:58,511 --> 00:21:59,721
Went missing a while back.

231
00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:03,141
No body yet,
but we're pretty sure, you know:

232
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:08,188
Probably chopped up into little pieces
and fed to the buzzards.

233
00:22:09,355 --> 00:22:11,149
Anyway, you...

234
00:22:11,357 --> 00:22:14,194
Any respirators like that
go missing lately?

235
00:22:14,652 --> 00:22:17,155
No. No.

236
00:22:17,489 --> 00:22:19,741
No, I mean, not that I know of.

237
00:22:20,283 --> 00:22:22,368
- I'll need to look at that inventory.
- Sure.

238
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:25,038
Sure.
I've got a list hanging on the wall.

239
00:22:25,246 --> 00:22:27,499
Do you mind if I take a look
at your storeroom?

240
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:29,542
Not at all. No.

241
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:31,544
Be my guest.

242
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:36,424
All right, so who's got keys?

243
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,094
The science faculty,
the staff, Carmen...

244
00:22:39,302 --> 00:22:43,348
...the vice-principal has the master,
and me.

245
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:45,475
How about students?

246
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,603
No, no. No students have keys.

247
00:22:48,812 --> 00:22:50,772
Shit, I should hope not.
My question is...

248
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,733
...do any of the little pissants
know where you keep them?

249
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:55,402
I don't... I don't think so, no.

250
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:58,696
I mean, besides, I keep them right here
in my pocket anyway, so...

251
00:22:58,905 --> 00:23:01,366
Walt, look,
I know they're your students...

252
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:03,993
...but do not underestimate them.
Big mistake.

253
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:07,205
- Are there any other respirators?
- No.

254
00:23:07,414 --> 00:23:10,250
Because I'm counting six,
inventory says eight.

255
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,589
- Glassware looking a little sparse.
- Is it?

256
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,762
Yeah. You're missing a couple of
Erlenmeyer flasks, at least.

257
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:24,556
Oh, yeah.

258
00:23:25,056 --> 00:23:28,351
A five-thousand millilitre
round-bottom.

259
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,813
Meth heads love to brew in this baby.

260
00:23:32,814 --> 00:23:36,568
- You gonna answer that?
- Oh, no, it's just... No, I don't...

261
00:23:36,776 --> 00:23:38,570
Maybe it's Skyler
and she's in trouble.

262
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:42,741
Shit, don't ignore it on my account.
Answer it. Come on, I got stuff to do.

263
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,368
- Jeez.
- Okay.

264
00:23:46,703 --> 00:23:49,914
- Hello?
<i>- Yo, what's up, Mr. W?</i>

265
00:23:51,082 --> 00:23:52,250
Speaking.

266
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:54,753
- Bad time to talk?
<i>- Absolutely. </i>

267
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:56,504
All right, so just listen.

268
00:23:56,713 --> 00:23:59,716
So you know that guy
we were talking about, Tuco?

269
00:23:59,924 --> 00:24:03,219
Turns out my boy, Skinny Pete,
was in the same cell block with him...

270
00:24:03,428 --> 00:24:04,679
...over at Los Lunas.

271
00:24:04,888 --> 00:24:09,642
<i>So we got our in. We're hauling</i>
<i>a pound to the dude right now. </i>

272
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:14,064
Okay, then. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much for calling.

273
00:24:16,858 --> 00:24:18,943
My doctor is very solicitous.

274
00:24:19,152 --> 00:24:22,655
Hey, look, buddy. The last thing
I wanna do is get you in hot water.

275
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:25,700
But some meth-monkey
had a feeding frenzy in here, okay?

276
00:24:26,242 --> 00:24:28,787
You gotta keep better watch
over your turf.

277
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:30,288
I will.

278
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:33,500
We don't want people
to start wondering about you, right?

279
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,135
Right. No. Right. Absolutely not.

280
00:24:47,722 --> 00:24:49,682
So you're sure
you're tight with this guy?

281
00:24:49,891 --> 00:24:52,685
Two nuts in a ball sack, yo.

282
00:25:08,993 --> 00:25:10,954
Yo, man, I'm Skinny Pete.

283
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:23,425
Maybe this isn't such a good idea, yo.
Come on.

284
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:30,473
Yeah, man, that's what's happening.

285
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,613
Yo, Tuco's expecting us.

286
00:25:55,373 --> 00:25:57,751
No need, man. Me and Tuco go back.

287
00:26:12,182 --> 00:26:15,602
Tuco, what's happening, my brother?

288
00:26:21,357 --> 00:26:25,403
Sick crib, yo. You've been keeping
it real since you been sprung.

289
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:28,531
- What's it been, like, a year?
- This your boy?

290
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,576
Yeah, Jesse. Dude with the glass
I was telling you about.

291
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:33,787
Hey, man, yeah.
I've heard a lot about you.

292
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:36,498
Break out the ice.

293
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:57,102
- Take a bump.
- No worries, man, I'm no cop.

294
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,146
I said, hit it.

295
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,734
All right.

296
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:23,294
This kicks like a mule
with his balls wrapped in duct tape.

297
00:27:25,213 --> 00:27:27,298
- Where'd you get it?
- I cooked it.

298
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:30,385
Bullshit.

299
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,097
Who you working for?

300
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:39,561
No one, man. I mean, I have a partner
that I cook with, but that's it.

301
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:44,023
All right.

302
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,236
We got a deal.

303
00:27:48,445 --> 00:27:50,321
See, I told you Tuco
would hook you up.

304
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:53,366
Cool. I haven't said how much.

305
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:05,253
All right. How much?

306
00:28:05,462 --> 00:28:07,255
Thirty-five large for the pound.

307
00:28:12,302 --> 00:28:15,221
Well, I mean, you're a little light, <i>ese</i>.

308
00:28:18,725 --> 00:28:20,977
It's all right, don't sweat it.
It's all good.

309
00:28:21,186 --> 00:28:23,104
It's good. Go on, get out of here.

310
00:28:24,564 --> 00:28:27,108
- What about the money?
- You'll get it.

311
00:28:27,317 --> 00:28:28,985
This is a consignment operation.

312
00:28:30,653 --> 00:28:33,907
You want me to flow it
thirty-five G's?

313
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:37,368
You don't trust me?

314
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:39,537
Hey, no, no, hey. It's not that, man.

315
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:42,874
It's just, you know,
I don't do business that way.

316
00:28:43,083 --> 00:28:45,752
Tough shit, the deal is done.

317
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:52,133
You said this was cool, okay?
Money for meth, cash up front.

318
00:28:52,342 --> 00:28:54,385
Don't front, dude, Tuco's good for it.

319
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:58,598
I don't need your punk ass
to vouch for me.

320
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:04,687
Come on.

321
00:29:05,605 --> 00:29:07,816
Oh, come on.

322
00:29:18,868 --> 00:29:24,082
All right. You brought me
some really clean crystal.

323
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:28,211
You really want your money up front?

324
00:29:51,943 --> 00:29:53,069
Up front.

325
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:29,022
Nobody moves crystal
in the South Valley but me, bitch.

326
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:50,252
Morning, Hugo.

327
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:55,340
You don't mind if I call you Hugo,
Hugo?

328
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:01,722
We've never had a problem
with Hugo, ever.

329
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,599
Is that Uncle Hank?

330
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:08,145
Right, what do you got there?
All right. Book him.

331
00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:11,982
Uncle Hank's
arresting Mr. Archilleya.

332
00:31:12,691 --> 00:31:15,611
This doesn't make any sense
to me at all. I don't understand.

333
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:18,822
I got two words for you:
Background check. How about that?

334
00:31:21,241 --> 00:31:24,328
<i>Yo, yo, yo. </i>
<i>1-4-8, 3-to-the-3, to-the-6, to-the-9.</i>

335
00:31:24,536 --> 00:31:27,414
<i>Representing the ABQ.</i>
<i>What up, biatch?</i>

336
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:29,458
<i>Leave it at the tone.</i>

337
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:33,295
Where the hell are you?
Call me back.

338
00:31:33,503 --> 00:31:35,881
- Hey, Walt?
- Yeah?

339
00:31:36,089 --> 00:31:41,345
- Hank's about to deal.
- Okay, I'll be right there.

340
00:31:47,142 --> 00:31:49,811
All right,
let's see what the turn brings us.

341
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:54,358
You're looking good, Walt.
Your colour's better.

342
00:31:54,566 --> 00:31:56,318
Yeah? Thanks.

343
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:59,321
He's actually on
the pretty strong stuff now.

344
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:03,200
Dr. Delcavoli's trying to talk him into
taking some time off from work, but...

345
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:05,994
Well, actually,
I just talked to Carmen this morning...

346
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:09,206
...and they're getting a substitute
for a few weeks.

347
00:32:09,414 --> 00:32:11,833
- Good.
- I just didn't have a chance to tell you.

348
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:14,586
- Sorry.
- Your bet, tough guy.

349
00:32:14,795 --> 00:32:16,463
Check.

350
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:18,340
Yeah, check.

351
00:32:18,882 --> 00:32:20,759
Cheque's in the mail.

352
00:32:21,593 --> 00:32:24,304
- Ten million.
- That's 25 million, blue's 10.

353
00:32:24,513 --> 00:32:27,307
Well, then, 25 million,
because that's how I roll.

354
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,351
Hey, Uncle Hank...

355
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,522
...I heard you arrested
Mr. Archilleya the other day.

356
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,815
He's a pretty cool guy.

357
00:32:35,023 --> 00:32:40,821
Well, turns out he has a record.
Yeah, a couple of possession beefs.

358
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:44,575
We figured he was the guy that was
stealing your school's chemistry gear.

359
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:48,996
I mean, you know,
he had a key, fit the profile.

360
00:32:49,204 --> 00:32:52,457
And when we searched his truck,
we found a big old fat blunt.

361
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:55,919
Which goes to prove
old huge Hugo ain't so cool after all.

362
00:32:56,128 --> 00:32:59,881
- It's to you, Walt.
- Yeah, I'll call.

363
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:02,217
You know,
I can't believe the school system...

364
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:04,261
...didn't know about this guy's record.

365
00:33:04,469 --> 00:33:07,014
I mean, that's scary.
How could something like that...

366
00:33:07,222 --> 00:33:09,600
...just slip through the cracks?
- I don't know.

367
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:14,897
I mean, for what it's worth,
Hugo just doesn't strike me as a thief.

368
00:33:15,105 --> 00:33:18,483
Yeah, well, nothing personal, Walt,
but you wouldn't know a criminal...

369
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:21,403
...if he was close enough
to check you for a hernia.

370
00:33:23,405 --> 00:33:28,035
That said, we got a search warrant,
and we tore old Hugo's house apart.

371
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:30,871
Turns out
he's a major-league pothead.

372
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,498
But he didn't raid your chemistry set.

373
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:35,167
You hiding something?

374
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:45,510
I'm in. And the river card.

375
00:33:48,138 --> 00:33:50,140
Yeah, I got nothing, I'm out.

376
00:33:50,349 --> 00:33:52,100
I'm out.

377
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,359
When old holes-in-her-purse bails,
you know you're in deep.

378
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:03,070
Looks like it's you and me, buddy.

379
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:06,949
What's gonna happen to him. Hugo?

380
00:34:07,658 --> 00:34:10,744
Well, I mean, he's gonna
lose his job, like he should.

381
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:14,748
Probably spend a couple months in
county, because it's not his first rap.

382
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,043
I'm waiting.

383
00:34:20,337 --> 00:34:22,631
You gonna man up
or are you gonna puss out?

384
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:24,466
Hank.

385
00:34:26,093 --> 00:34:27,636
Sorry.

386
00:34:30,556 --> 00:34:32,266
I'm all in.

387
00:34:35,686 --> 00:34:41,441
Dude.
You bad, bad, bad, horrible liar.

388
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,987
What are you smoking there, huh?

389
00:34:46,196 --> 00:34:48,865
You got a heart?
You got the flush, don't you?

390
00:34:53,495 --> 00:34:56,456
Nope. Not falling for it, buddy. I fold.

391
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,502
- Talk about anti-climactic.
- Hey.

392
00:35:00,711 --> 00:35:02,963
Your cards couldn't have been
that bad, come on.

393
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:05,299
Oh, my God. You threw away an ace?

394
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:08,260
- What are you doing?
- And a cowboy for...

395
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:16,768
A handful of nothing.

396
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:15,953
<i>Yeah, what up?</i>

397
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:20,666
Who is this?
I was dialling Jesse Pinkman.

398
00:36:20,874 --> 00:36:23,627
<i>Hey, man, he's out. </i>

399
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:26,421
Well, where is he, then?

400
00:36:40,644 --> 00:36:42,104
You the guy?

401
00:36:42,813 --> 00:36:45,023
Yeah, I'm the guy.

402
00:36:50,153 --> 00:36:51,947
How is he?

403
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:55,576
Got some busted ribs, and like that.

404
00:36:56,535 --> 00:36:58,161
Got messed up pretty good.

405
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:02,749
I was all, like,
"Damn, Tuco, chill, <i>ese</i>."

406
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:06,336
I don't know what got into him.
Seriously.

407
00:37:09,256 --> 00:37:11,425
He's out, man. Way out.

408
00:37:12,426 --> 00:37:14,720
They got him doped up big time.

409
00:37:20,601 --> 00:37:22,102
So you're the cook, huh?

410
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:26,648
Yo, I didn't catch your name.

411
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,998
Tell me about this Tuco.

412
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,084
Tell me everything about him.

413
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:30,647
Morning.

414
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:35,652
Could you pass the butter, please?

415
00:39:38,363 --> 00:39:39,865
Badass, Dad.

416
00:40:26,912 --> 00:40:31,166
Hey, cue ball. Need directions?

417
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,294
You Tuco?

418
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,263
I want to talk to Tuco,
and I'm not leaving until I do.

419
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:09,598
What's your name?

420
00:42:10,515 --> 00:42:12,434
Heisenberg.

421
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:16,230
Heisenberg. Okay.

422
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,148
Have a seat, Heisenberg.

423
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:22,069
I don't imagine I'll be here very long.

424
00:42:22,277 --> 00:42:23,904
No?

425
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:26,073
All right.

426
00:42:27,616 --> 00:42:28,700
Be that way.

427
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,205
It's your meeting.

428
00:42:33,413 --> 00:42:36,583
Why don't you start talking
and tell me what you want?

429
00:42:37,709 --> 00:42:39,503
Fifty thousand dollars.

430
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:45,509
Oh, man.
Fifty G's? How you figure that?

431
00:42:45,717 --> 00:42:48,220
Thirty-five
for the pound of meth you stole...

432
00:42:48,428 --> 00:42:51,223
...and another fifteen
for my partner's pain and suffering.

433
00:42:57,062 --> 00:42:58,855
Partner.

434
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:09,241
Oh, yeah, I remember that little bitch.

435
00:43:09,783 --> 00:43:11,535
So you must be Daddy.

436
00:43:20,252 --> 00:43:22,254
Let me get this straight.

437
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:25,757
I steal your dope...

438
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:30,679
...I beat the piss
out of your mule boy...

439
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:35,976
...and then you walk in here
and you bring me more meth?

440
00:43:39,897 --> 00:43:41,732
That's a brilliant plan, <i>ese</i>.

441
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,442
Brilliant.

442
00:43:44,776 --> 00:43:47,613
You got one part of that wrong.

443
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:54,244
This is not meth.

444
00:44:21,438 --> 00:44:23,148
Are you fucking nuts?

445
00:44:23,357 --> 00:44:24,733
You wanna find out?

446
00:44:25,984 --> 00:44:28,570
No, no, Gonzo, <i>calma. </i>

447
00:44:33,033 --> 00:44:36,370
You got balls, I'll give you that.

448
00:44:36,578 --> 00:44:40,165
All right, all right.
I'll give you your money.

449
00:44:44,211 --> 00:44:48,715
That crystal
that your partner brought me...

450
00:44:48,924 --> 00:44:53,971
...it sold faster than ten-dollar ass
in TJ.

451
00:44:57,724 --> 00:45:01,562
Let's say you bring me
another pound next week.

452
00:45:05,065 --> 00:45:06,400
Money up front.

453
00:45:07,067 --> 00:45:08,569
All right.

454
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:10,737
Money up front.

455
00:45:15,784 --> 00:45:18,579
Sometimes you gotta rob
to keep your riches.

456
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:23,500
Just as long as we got
an understanding.

457
00:45:26,086 --> 00:45:30,549
One pound is not gonna cut it.
You have to take two.

458
00:45:36,972 --> 00:45:38,181
Oh, really?

459
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,269
Hey, what is that shit?

460
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:46,982
Fulminated mercury...

461
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,444
...and a little tweak of chemistry.

9999

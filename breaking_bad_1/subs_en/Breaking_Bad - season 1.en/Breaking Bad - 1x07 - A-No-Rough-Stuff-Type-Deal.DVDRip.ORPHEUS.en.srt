1
00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:05,264
In closing, I can tell you...

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:09,768
...we take this very seriously.
APD as well as the DEA.

3
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:12,146
Stopping the sale
of methamphetamines...

4
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,315
...remains one of
our highest priorities.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:18,485
The theft of lab equipment from your
school is also receiving our attention.

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,613
Rest assured,
no stone will go unturned...

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,867
...in our search for the person
or persons responsible for this.

8
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,911
If you have any questions,
now would be the time. Sir.

9
00:00:28,078 --> 00:00:31,206
You're talking like
you haven't caught anybody yet.

10
00:00:31,415 --> 00:00:33,667
What about the janitor
dealing drugs at school?

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:37,504
There is no indication
that this individual was selling drugs.

12
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,466
He was arrested for having
a small amount of marijuana...

13
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:43,010
...in his car, not in the school.

14
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,970
And he's since been fired.

15
00:00:45,137 --> 00:00:49,099
He had a record. I'd like to know
how he got a job here in the first place.

16
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:50,976
Why wasn't there
a background check?

17
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:55,522
There was one. We're currently
reviewing our hiring policies.

18
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,193
You better be doing more. This guy
was arrested in front of my daughter.

19
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,487
This guy was stealing
lab equipment, right?

20
00:01:01,654 --> 00:01:03,697
That's not our thinking this time.

21
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:07,159
We're looking at others, but not
limited to the maintenance staff.

22
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:10,579
Are you saying there was a break-in?
Do we know when this happened?

23
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:13,207
I mean, could it have been
during school hours?

24
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:16,710
We haven't been able to establish
a date or time. There is no sign...

25
00:01:16,877 --> 00:01:18,212
...of breaking or entering.

26
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,756
So whoever took it had a key.

27
00:01:20,923 --> 00:01:24,218
We're talking inside job?
Someone who's still at the school?

28
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:28,514
Sir, at this time I'm not able to discuss
details with you. What I can tell you...

29
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:31,225
...is we have good people
working hard on this case.

30
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:34,395
I'm sorry, officer,
but that just sounds like double talk.

31
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,189
We're trying to protect our children.
Level with us.

32
00:01:37,356 --> 00:01:40,484
Really, we're giving you
all the information we have.

33
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,529
You know what I'd like to see
in school? Drug-sniffing dogs.

34
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:47,574
Yeah. Dogs and metal detectors and
locker searches and strip-searches.

35
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,578
- Our district has strict policies...
- I heard about this school in Canada...

36
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,456
...they arrested one
of the groundskeepers with drugs...

37
00:01:54,623 --> 00:01:58,252
...and the next day they found out over
half the students were high on LSD.

38
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:01,171
LSD? When were you gonna tell us
about the LSD?

39
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:06,010
No, please.
No one said anything about LSD.

40
00:02:09,471 --> 00:02:11,348
What about the equipment
that's stolen?

41
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:15,019
The equipment was taken
from our chemistry-department locker.

42
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:17,479
And tonight we're lucky
to have someone here...

43
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:19,732
...to give us some specifics.

44
00:02:19,898 --> 00:02:21,483
Walt?

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,320
Yeah.

46
00:02:24,486 --> 00:02:28,574
Mr. White
is currently on medical leave.

47
00:02:28,782 --> 00:02:30,951
But as he's chair
of the science department...

48
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:34,330
...he's made a very special effort
to be with us here.

49
00:02:34,496 --> 00:02:38,334
And I'd like to take a moment
to thank him for that.

50
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,387
Could you please tell us more
about the equipment that was taken?

51
00:02:50,554 --> 00:02:52,931
- Please.
- Yes.

52
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:54,725
Sorry.

53
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,145
And thank you.

54
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:05,235
The inventory list
for the missing lab-wear is as follows:

55
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:10,616
<i>One 5000 millilitre</i>
<i>round-bottom boiling flask. </i>

56
00:03:10,783 --> 00:03:15,412
<i>One Kildall-style recovery flask,</i>
<i>800 millilitres. </i>

57
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,457
<i>Two full-face respirators. </i>

58
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:22,461
<i>Some CEP funnels, some head</i>
<i>with a thermometer holder. </i>

59
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,013
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

60
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:41,522
Where did that come from?
And why was it so damn good?

61
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,317
Because it was illegal.

62
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:27,234
The basement.
Unfinished, of course.

63
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:32,323
But just look at all this space.
You gotta think rec room, media room.

64
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:35,576
Just imagine all the things
you could do down here.

65
00:04:35,784 --> 00:04:39,455
Now remember, you're buying
for this fantastic neighbourhood.

66
00:04:39,621 --> 00:04:44,084
Big lawns and shade trees,
walking distance to the country club.

67
00:04:51,008 --> 00:04:53,052
What happened there?

68
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:58,349
Bit of a fixer,
but this house has great bones.

69
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:06,440
Know what? We're zeroing in. I've got
another listing, new, around the corner.

70
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:07,900
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

71
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,527
- Hi.
- Hi.

72
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,991
- It's by appointment only.
- Oh, well, I'm here to see the owner.

73
00:05:16,492 --> 00:05:21,622
He's in the recreational vehicle.

74
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:30,089
Yo, it's appointment only.

75
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:43,978
How are you feeling?

76
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:53,278
About as good as you look.
Jeez, you look like Lex Luthor.

77
00:05:53,445 --> 00:05:56,448
Listen, I visited you in the hospital,
but you were asleep.

78
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:59,868
Yeah, Skinny Pete
said you wanted Tuco's address.

79
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:02,705
Acting like you're all out for blood.

80
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:06,458
But you are alive.
Obviously you wised up.

81
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,378
- No, I did go see him.
- Bullshit.

82
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:12,548
- So, what, are you selling your house?
- I got two dudes...

83
00:06:12,715 --> 00:06:15,843
...that turned into raspberry slushy
and flushed down my toilet.

84
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,429
I can't even
take a proper dump in there.

85
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:22,016
I mean, the whole damn house
has gotta be haunted by now.

86
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,519
You didn't actually go see Tuco.

87
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,147
Here.

88
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:35,321
That is 17,500.
Your half of the 35,000.

89
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:39,908
Plus, there's an extra 15 in there.
It's all yours. You've earned it.

90
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,661
- You got this money from Tuco?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:42,828 --> 00:06:45,748
So Tuco gave you this,
is what you're saying.

92
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:46,957
Well, we made a deal.

93
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:49,585
- You made a deal?
- That's right.

94
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:53,922
How...? Why would you
make a deal with that scumbag?

95
00:06:54,089 --> 00:06:56,383
- You see what he did to me?
- Because I think...

96
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,220
...that we can do business together.
We came to an understanding.

97
00:07:00,429 --> 00:07:02,681
No way, man.
Okay? No understanding.

98
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,892
Take a look
at the money in your hand.

99
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:08,646
Now, just imagine
making that every week.

100
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:13,484
That's right.
Two pounds a week, 35,000 a pound.

101
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:19,823
Without even talking to me
you told this insane ass-clown...

102
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,369
...dead-eyed killer that...

103
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:25,412
That we would
give him 2 pounds a week.

104
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:28,290
We'll just scale up our operation,
add a few more hours.

105
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,084
No, don't talk to me about hours.

106
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,545
What about pseudo, man?
How are we gonna get that?

107
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:37,508
You think the meth fairy's
just gonna bring it to us?

108
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:40,094
God, it takes me a week
to get this stuff.

109
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:42,346
I'm driving
all the way to Las Cruces...

110
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,557
...200 miles each way
to meet up with my smurfs.

111
00:07:45,766 --> 00:07:48,727
- Smurfs?
- The dudes who go to the drugstores...

112
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:51,814
...and get a couple boxes at a time
and then sell them to me.

113
00:07:52,022 --> 00:07:54,900
That's maybe only good for,
like, maybe a half-pound worth.

114
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:59,154
See, that's the bottleneck
in your brilliant business plan.

115
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,364
All right.

116
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,951
Of course, you would've know
that if you would've just asked me.

117
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:09,540
- Well, here we are again.
- Here we are.

118
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,375
- Skyler, you look great.
- Thank you.

119
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:13,919
You must be, what, 6, 7 months?

120
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,339
- How goes it?
- It's great.

121
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:21,218
Other than waddling
to the bathroom every five minutes.

122
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:23,595
The baby shower is next week.

123
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,848
And it'll be good to...

124
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,601
It'll be good to have a day
that's just about Skyler.

125
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,729
Very nice.

126
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:34,189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:38,193
- Walt, I see you committed to hair loss.
- Yeah.

128
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,696
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

129
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:44,241
L... You know, pretty decent, actually.

130
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,703
His colour is better.
You know, his energy.

131
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:52,416
And he's even more physical.

132
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,126
More physical?

133
00:08:54,293 --> 00:08:57,421
Well, sexual.

134
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:03,636
Frisky, actually. I mean,
that's gotta be a good sign, right?

135
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:06,972
- Sure, I'll take that. Right, Walt?
- Right.

136
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,642
Couldn't that mean
that the chemo is working?

137
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:13,854
Well, realistically, it may just mean that
we've got the antiemetics tuned right.

138
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:16,982
Truth is, until Walt's finished
this round of chemo...

139
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,444
...and we look at a new PET scan,
we just can't say for sure.

140
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:23,197
Well, isn't there anything else
we could be doing?

141
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:26,492
I've been wondering
about alternative medicine.

142
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,079
I mean, Eastern healing.

143
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:34,458
- You know, holistic.
- Well, I can't speak to its efficacy...

144
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:37,503
...but as long as it doesn't
interfere with our treatment...

145
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,631
...anything that helps my patient
have a better outlook...

146
00:09:40,798 --> 00:09:44,551
...a better comfort, is fine by me.

147
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:49,014
So you're saying
it's just all psychological.

148
00:09:49,181 --> 00:09:51,433
It doesn't make any real difference.

149
00:09:51,642 --> 00:09:55,229
Having a better outlook
can make a tremendous difference.

150
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:59,525
But it's also important
that we manage our expectations.

151
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:21,463
What?

152
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,556
A junkyard?
Let me guess, you picked this place?

153
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:34,518
What's wrong with it? It's private.

154
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:39,064
This is like a non-criminal's
idea of a drug meet.

155
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:41,984
This is, "Oh, I saw this in a movie.
Look at me. "

156
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:45,946
Yes. So where do you transact
your business? Enlighten me.

157
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:48,907
I don't know,
how about Taco Cabeza?

158
00:10:49,074 --> 00:10:52,036
Half the deals I've ever done
went down at Taco Cabeza.

159
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:56,623
Nice and public. Open 24 hours.

160
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,252
Nobody ever gets shot
at Taco Cabeza.

161
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:03,464
Hell, why not the mall?

162
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:07,051
You know, wait at the Gap.
Hey, it's time for the meet.

163
00:11:07,217 --> 00:11:10,012
You know, I'll put down
the flat-front khakis...

164
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,473
...head on over,
grab an Orange Julius.

165
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,268
Skip the part where
psycho-lunatic Tuco, you know...

166
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:20,189
...comes and steals my drugs
and leaves me bleeding to death.

167
00:11:29,365 --> 00:11:32,159
Look, you don't
have to be here for this.

168
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:34,244
Okay? I mean, seriously.

169
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,205
I'm okay.

170
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,418
No. I'm no pussy.

171
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:43,963
I'm good.

172
00:12:00,938 --> 00:12:02,898
Mr. Clean and his boy.

173
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,027
Now, I'm sorry
that I had to tune you up.

174
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:10,447
Respect, <i>ése,</i>
you gotta give it to get it.

175
00:12:14,118 --> 00:12:16,620
Hey, what are we doing
way the hell out here?

176
00:12:16,787 --> 00:12:19,540
What, they close the mall
or something?

177
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,627
Heisenberg, come on, break it out.

178
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:31,719
- That's it? That's all you got?
- We had some production problems.

179
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,054
0.53.

180
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,515
I thought you was a player.

181
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,643
You told me 2 pounds...

182
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,272
...and now you waste my time
with these Chiclets?

183
00:12:53,657 --> 00:12:58,620
Seventeen and a half.
Minus the half for wasting my time.

184
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,248
- Hey, come on.
- What, you gonna argue?

185
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,876
You got something to say?

186
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,715
You're doing business
like a couple little bitches.

187
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:12,134
I want all of it.

188
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,972
Seventy grand.

189
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,600
- What did you say?
- You like this product.

190
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,685
And you want more.

191
00:13:21,852 --> 00:13:24,813
Consider it a capital investment.

192
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,069
Look, old, bald motherfucker.

193
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:36,450
Fifty-two and a half, 25 points vig.

194
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,036
Vig?

195
00:13:40,371 --> 00:13:42,289
Interest, weekly.

196
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,001
Okay.

197
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,967
That's $65,625 with interest.

198
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:57,346
- 1.875 pounds.
- No, 2 pounds.

199
00:13:57,513 --> 00:14:00,933
Next Friday,
and no production problems.

200
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,603
Can you handle 4 pounds?

201
00:14:08,941 --> 00:14:12,152
Listen, old man, talk is talk.

202
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:17,324
But owing me money, that's bad.

203
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:42,725
What did you just do?

204
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,859
4 pounds. 4 pounds.
2 pounds wasn't bad enough.

205
00:14:52,026 --> 00:14:56,113
We're talking 2-, 300 boxes
of sinus pills.

206
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,282
There ain't that many smurfs
in the world.

207
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,451
We're not gonna need
pseudoephedrine.

208
00:15:00,617 --> 00:15:03,495
We're gonna make phenylacetone
in a tube furnace.

209
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:07,958
We're gonna use reductive amination
to yield methamphetamine, 4 pounds.

210
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,878
- So no pseudo?
- No pseudo.

211
00:15:11,045 --> 00:15:12,838
So you do have a plan.

212
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:15,299
Yeah, Mr. White.

213
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,884
Yeah, science.

214
00:15:17,718 --> 00:15:19,553
Okay.

215
00:15:22,723 --> 00:15:26,101
- What's this?
- That is a shopping list.

216
00:15:26,602 --> 00:15:29,772
Getting some of those items
may be challenging.

217
00:15:30,397 --> 00:15:32,274
One autotransformer...

218
00:15:32,441 --> 00:15:38,030
...6 litres anhydrous methenamine.

219
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:42,451
- Two 35 M and M tube furnaces.
- It's mm, millimetre.

220
00:15:42,618 --> 00:15:45,788
One 70 millimetre would be fine,
but they're hard to come by.

221
00:15:45,954 --> 00:15:48,248
40 grams thorium nitrate.

222
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:51,168
Yo, Mr. White,
I can't even pronounce half this shit.

223
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:53,045
No. Count me out. All right?

224
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:55,714
I'm leaving town.
I'm moving to Oregon or something.

225
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:58,550
- This is just...
- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse. Listen to me.

226
00:15:58,717 --> 00:16:04,014
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

227
00:16:04,181 --> 00:16:07,101
- What are you doing?
- The first day of the rest of your life.

228
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,894
But what kind of life will it be?

229
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:12,940
Will it be a life of fear,
of "Oh, no, no, no. I can't do this. "

230
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:16,026
Of never once believing in yourself?

231
00:16:17,403 --> 00:16:19,655
- I don't know.
- Listen.

232
00:16:19,822 --> 00:16:22,866
These things?
We need them, all right?

233
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,744
And only you can get them for us.

234
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:35,713
<i>Okay, it's ready. Here you go. </i>

235
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,592
<i>Hi, baby. I'm your Aunt Marie.</i>

236
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:43,762
<i>Of course you already know that</i>
<i>because when you watch this... </i>

237
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,182
<i>...20 years from now, I will look</i>
<i>exactly the same as I do now. </i>

238
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:52,938
<i>I know, it is amazing. </i>
<i>I have aged shockingly well. Haven't I?</i>

239
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:58,527
<i>Anyway, weIcome to your baby shower,</i>
<i>Esmeralda. </i>

240
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,488
<i>- Esmeralda?</i>
<i>- Esmeralda. </i>

241
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,907
<i>That's your name</i>
<i>and you heard it here first. </i>

242
00:17:04,074 --> 00:17:08,537
<i>Now, that is your wonderful,</i>
<i>handsome older brother. </i>

243
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:11,498
<i>Show her, older brother, your face.</i>

244
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:16,920
<i>Okay, not right up the nose. Don't... </i>
<i>Okay, not up it. Back. Back to me.</i>

245
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:21,925
<i>Here's your mommy. Hello, Mom. </i>

246
00:17:22,092 --> 00:17:25,429
<i>- And look, there you are, Esmeralda. </i>
<i>- Yeah. </i>

247
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:32,144
<i>- Wake up, baby. Time to party. </i>
<i>- Easy, easy. Believe it or not... </i>

248
00:17:32,311 --> 00:17:37,441
<i>...Esmeralda, right after the party,</i>
<i>your name was changed to Holly. </i>

249
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:39,902
<i>And I believe, Hank,</i>
<i>that was around the time...</i>

250
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,112
<i>...we took Aunt Marie</i>
<i>to the insane asylum. </i>

251
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:44,573
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. </i>
<i>I dropped her off at the kerb. </i>

252
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:48,827
<i>Then I married Shania Twain</i>
<i>and lived happily ever after. </i>

253
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:56,877
<i>There's Daddy. Speak, Daddy. </i>
<i>Say hello to your daughter. </i>

254
00:18:02,174 --> 00:18:05,177
<i>Holly, I am very proud of you. </i>

255
00:18:05,344 --> 00:18:09,765
<i>And I... </i>
<i>I think about you all the time.</i>

256
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:18,899
<i>Wherever you go,</i>
<i>whatever you do in life...</i>

257
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:24,947
<i>...always know that you have a family</i>
<i>who loves you very, very much. </i>

258
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,244
<i>- Cheers. </i>
<i>- Cheers. </i>

259
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:35,124
Oh, my God, it's so cute.
Oh, Carmen. It's...

260
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,627
Oh, look. Look at that. It's adorable.

261
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:42,172
- I love it, Carmen. Thank you.
- You're so welcome, honey.

262
00:18:42,339 --> 00:18:45,592
- Thank you.
- Look at the little feet.

263
00:18:48,262 --> 00:18:53,183
- Okay.
- From me. And Hank.

264
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,643
What nice wrapping paper.

265
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:56,979
Marie always finds
the best wrapping paper.

266
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,023
- I do.
- Okay.

267
00:18:59,189 --> 00:19:03,152
Let's see. And...

268
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:04,611
Exciting.

269
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,325
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

270
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:19,543
- It's... It's a... A tiara.
- Yes.

271
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:23,922
Marie, is this...?

272
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:27,926
White gold and several carats
worth of zircons.

273
00:19:28,093 --> 00:19:30,596
Oh, Marie.
You spent too much on this.

274
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,974
You shouldn't have.
You really, really shouldn't.

275
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:38,145
But it's so... It's really... It's...

276
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:39,438
It's sparkly.

277
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,775
- Sparkly.
- I know.

278
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:45,861
- Thank you.
- Hey, listen, Walt.

279
00:19:46,028 --> 00:19:47,821
You got anything
stronger than beer?

280
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,824
- It's... It's great. I love it.
- Yeah.

281
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:55,371
Thank you.
Thank you, sweetie, thank you.

282
00:19:55,579 --> 00:20:01,001
Sorry, man. It's just, you know, after
200 presents, it just gets kind of old.

283
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:06,423
- It's nice stuff.
- It is, isn't it?

284
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:12,972
I got just the thing to go with that.

285
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:21,480
- I'm sorry, man, I wasn't thinking.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

286
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:23,565
You mind if I have one?

287
00:20:24,441 --> 00:20:29,238
- You think that's a good idea?
- Hank, I've already got lung cancer.

288
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:33,534
Okay. You got me there.

289
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:36,787
Thanks.

290
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,458
Cuban.

291
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:48,549
I did a little favour for an FBI guy.

292
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:54,430
Now, I was under the impression...

293
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:57,057
...that these were illegal.

294
00:20:58,017 --> 00:21:04,189
Yeah, well, sometimes forbidden fruit
tastes the sweetest, doesn't it?

295
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:12,323
It's funny, isn't it?
How we draw that line.

296
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:14,116
Yeah.

297
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,493
What line is that?

298
00:21:17,536 --> 00:21:24,251
Well, what's legal, what's illegal.
You know, Cuban cigars, alcohol.

299
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:30,174
You know, if we were drinking this
in 1930, we'd be breaking the law.

300
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,594
Another year, we'd be okay.

301
00:21:35,137 --> 00:21:37,598
Who knows
what will be legal next year.

302
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,851
You mean like pot?

303
00:21:43,479 --> 00:21:49,818
Yeah. Like pot. Or whatever.

304
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:53,906
Cocaine? Heroin?

305
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,618
I'm just saying it's arbitrary.

306
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:03,415
Well, you ought to visit lockup.
You hear a lot of guys talking like that.

307
00:22:03,582 --> 00:22:07,252
"Hey, man, what you busting me
with these 14 bales of ganja?

308
00:22:07,419 --> 00:22:12,049
It's all going to be legal next year
when Willie Nelson's president. "

309
00:22:12,216 --> 00:22:13,634
Say it, buddy.

310
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:15,886
It don't only go one way either.

311
00:22:16,053 --> 00:22:19,431
I mean, some other stuff is legal
that shouldn't be.

312
00:22:19,598 --> 00:22:23,894
I mean,
frigging meth used to be legal.

313
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:28,440
Used to sell it over every counter
at every pharmacy across America.

314
00:22:28,607 --> 00:22:31,986
Thank God they came to their senses
on that one, huh?

315
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:36,240
Yeah.

316
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:43,872
Okay.

317
00:22:49,044 --> 00:22:51,380
Nice party.

318
00:22:54,341 --> 00:22:56,802
A tiara.

319
00:22:56,969 --> 00:23:01,640
A white-gold tiara
for a newborn baby.

320
00:23:01,807 --> 00:23:07,021
Yeah. You know, I think she got that
at Gertrude Zachary's in Knob Hill.

321
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:13,527
I mean, that thing must've cost,
like, what, 5- or 600 dollars.

322
00:23:15,988 --> 00:23:18,615
You know, I think I'm gonna return it.

323
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:21,410
Are you sure?
She's bound to find out.

324
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:25,664
Well, maybe I can explain to her
that we need a Diaper Genie...

325
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:30,753
...more than a white-gold baby tiara.

326
00:23:33,088 --> 00:23:34,840
Hey. You know, I've been thinking...

327
00:23:35,007 --> 00:23:38,344
...about what you said to Dr. Delcavoli
about alternative medicine.

328
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,013
No. Don't worry.
I'm not gonna mention that anymore.

329
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:45,601
No, no, no. What I mean is that
maybe there is something to it.

330
00:23:46,852 --> 00:23:53,400
Look. They do this Navajo sweat lodge
up by Farmington.

331
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:57,488
Healing ceremony. It's supposed
to be good for your lungs.

332
00:23:57,655 --> 00:24:00,032
I'm not saying that I believe in it...

333
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:05,704
...but it might be an experience.

334
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:07,581
Really.

335
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,541
You?

336
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,001
In a sweat lodge.

337
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:15,297
I was thinking about driving up
on Friday, coming back Sunday.

338
00:24:15,464 --> 00:24:19,468
- I mean, if you're okay with it.
- Well, of course I'm okay with that.

339
00:24:19,635 --> 00:24:21,220
Okay.

340
00:24:30,354 --> 00:24:32,231
- Sweat lodge?
- Yeah.

341
00:24:32,398 --> 00:24:34,900
I'm already sweating. Help me out.

342
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:37,861
Okay.

343
00:24:38,028 --> 00:24:39,905
Hey.

344
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:44,076
70 millimetre tube furnace. Excellent.

345
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:46,495
- This is excellent. Good work.
- Damn straight.

346
00:24:46,662 --> 00:24:49,623
Okay, hydrogen.
Electrolytically produced, yes?

347
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,709
Yeah, like you asked. I mean, this...

348
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:55,421
This crap wasn't easy to get.
And it's expensive.

349
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,381
Methylamine.
Where's the methylamine?

350
00:24:57,548 --> 00:24:59,258
I don't see the methylamine.

351
00:24:59,425 --> 00:25:03,387
Yeah, well,
that's where I ran into some trouble.

352
00:25:03,554 --> 00:25:04,972
What kind a trouble?

353
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:07,349
Well, half this crap
I could just buy, right?

354
00:25:07,516 --> 00:25:10,686
But this methylamine...

355
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:14,273
Not so easy.
I mean, they got it locked down tight.

356
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,651
But I did find some pros
who will rip it off for us.

357
00:25:17,818 --> 00:25:20,696
But they want 10 grand.

358
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:22,698
What's the problem?
You have the money.

359
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:25,451
No, had.
I spent almost the whole wad.

360
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:29,872
I mean, I got, like, 2 grand left.
I told you, all this crap was expensive.

361
00:25:30,122 --> 00:25:34,043
So these thieves, did they say
where they would be stealing it from?

362
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:36,962
A chemical supply place,
south of town.

363
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:41,216
They got guards and security cameras.
They got steel doors.

364
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:44,762
That's why these dudes
are charging so much.

365
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,597
What?

366
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:04,239
So why don't we
just steal it ourselves.

367
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:07,159
Yeah?

368
00:26:07,326 --> 00:26:09,495
How we gonna do that?

369
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:12,539
With this.

370
00:26:27,012 --> 00:26:29,181
So, what's this stuff called again?

371
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,103
Thermite.

372
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:36,522
And that will cut through a lock?

373
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:39,358
Because this is supposed to be
one big-ass lock.

374
00:26:39,525 --> 00:26:42,069
In World War II...

375
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:46,240
...the Germans had an artillery piece...
It's the biggest in the world.

376
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:48,367
Called the Gustav Gun.

377
00:26:48,534 --> 00:26:51,161
And it weighed a thousand tons.

378
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:55,666
And the Gustav
was capable of firing a 7-ton shell...

379
00:26:55,833 --> 00:27:00,296
...and hitting a target,
accurately, 23 miles away.

380
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,634
I mean, you could drop bombs on it
every day for a month...

381
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:08,262
...without ever disabling it.

382
00:27:08,762 --> 00:27:10,222
But...

383
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:12,349
...drop a commando...

384
00:27:12,516 --> 00:27:16,729
...one man, with just a bag of this...

385
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:21,900
...and he could melt right through
4 inches of solid steel...

386
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:24,320
...and destroy that gun forever.

387
00:27:27,364 --> 00:27:29,283
Jeez.

388
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:34,079
So yes...

389
00:27:34,913 --> 00:27:39,376
...I think it will cut through
any lock we're likely to find.

390
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:44,256
- You'd like to return this.
- It's very nice, but yes.

391
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:46,634
Well, it... It is from the store, isn't it?

392
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,511
Oh, yes, it's from this store.

393
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:51,847
Do you happen to have a receipt?

394
00:27:52,014 --> 00:27:54,516
No, I don't. It was a gift.

395
00:27:55,267 --> 00:27:56,435
A gift.

396
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,854
Mr. Wilson,
could you step over here, please?

397
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:04,943
Mr. Wilson, I'd like you to watch
this lady while I phone the police.

398
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:06,987
Whoa, excuse me?

399
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:10,699
Ma'am, this item is stolen,
as I'm sure you know.

400
00:28:10,866 --> 00:28:13,285
- It...
- Come with me, please.

401
00:28:15,245 --> 00:28:19,625
Oh, yes. I intend to press charges.

402
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:22,503
Please do.

403
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:25,005
We'll be here.

404
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:30,552
Look, I...
I've never stolen anything in my life.

405
00:28:30,719 --> 00:28:34,807
All right?
I told you, that tiara was a gift...

406
00:28:34,974 --> 00:28:38,185
- A baby-shower gift.
- So who gave it to you, then?

407
00:28:40,604 --> 00:28:43,941
- I don't have to tell you that.
- You don't have to tell me anything.

408
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:45,943
You can talk to the police.

409
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:48,445
I can tell them
my daughter-in-law remembers...

410
00:28:48,612 --> 00:28:51,615
...showing this particular item
to a tall blond woman...

411
00:28:51,782 --> 00:28:55,077
...who, when her back was turned,
walked right out the door with it.

412
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:56,996
- So there.
- Oh, yeah?

413
00:28:57,162 --> 00:29:01,166
Well, then, I can talk
to the Channel Three News.

414
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:05,296
Yeah, I can tell them
how you people, without a shred...

415
00:29:05,462 --> 00:29:08,507
Without a modicum of evidence,
illegally detained...

416
00:29:08,674 --> 00:29:13,137
...an innocent pregnant woman
in a dank storeroom.

417
00:29:13,304 --> 00:29:17,099
- This is my office.
- I feel I'm being held hostage.

418
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:20,936
Furthermore, I'm not
getting enough air back here.

419
00:29:21,145 --> 00:29:23,731
I don't think...
I don't think I can breathe.

420
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,775
Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, no.

421
00:29:26,942 --> 00:29:30,070
I'm going into labour. Yes, I...

422
00:29:40,998 --> 00:29:43,208
<i>Hi, you've reached Marie.</i>
<i>Do the beep thing. </i>

423
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:46,795
Marie, it's Skyler.
I just left Zachary's.

424
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,883
I need to talk to you immediately.

425
00:29:52,217 --> 00:29:55,387
Where is the guard?
He's supposed to be coming by.

426
00:29:55,554 --> 00:29:58,724
- Do you think he already passed?
- Look, I don't... I don't know.

427
00:29:58,891 --> 00:29:59,933
Okay.

428
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,478
- Wait, there he is. There he is.
- Yeah, I see him.

429
00:30:02,645 --> 00:30:04,313
Wait... Wait till he passes.

430
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,065
Okay, it's clear.

431
00:30:10,235 --> 00:30:11,320
Here.

432
00:30:14,156 --> 00:30:16,617
- What the hell is this?
- It's all they had.

433
00:30:16,784 --> 00:30:19,787
If this is all they had,
you're in the wrong place.

434
00:30:19,953 --> 00:30:21,288
Just put it on.

435
00:30:21,455 --> 00:30:23,415
Should've... Of course.

436
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:32,091
Okay, okay.

437
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:35,594
Okay. This is it.

438
00:30:37,054 --> 00:30:39,014
Oh, God.

439
00:30:51,235 --> 00:30:52,903
Okay.

440
00:30:54,863 --> 00:30:56,031
- Get...
- What?

441
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:58,158
- Look.
- What?

442
00:30:58,575 --> 00:30:59,994
Hey, Jimmy, I'm stopping...

443
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,455
He's not supposed to come back.
What's he doing?

444
00:31:03,872 --> 00:31:05,165
Oh, my God.

445
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,876
<i>Hope everything comes out all right. </i>

446
00:31:08,043 --> 00:31:11,338
- He's going to the crapper.
- Oh, God.

447
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:14,550
- Okay. You coming, man? Come on.
- What are you doing?

448
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:48,959
Okay, there it is.

449
00:31:51,629 --> 00:31:53,213
Is this gonna be loud?

450
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,008
You'll find out in about 10 seconds.

451
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,218
Stand back.

452
00:32:01,347 --> 00:32:02,431
Jesus.

453
00:32:14,151 --> 00:32:15,903
Come on, come on.

454
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,908
Hey, what's going on?

455
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:27,331
- Where are the gallon jugs?
- I don't...

456
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,959
- God!
- What?

457
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,503
Let's just take this.
Come on, come on.

458
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,421
What the...?

459
00:32:35,089 --> 00:32:36,840
Damn it.

460
00:32:42,596 --> 00:32:44,306
What are you doing
opening the door?

461
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:47,601
- How are we gonna take this thing out?
- Come on. Take that.

462
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,645
Lift.

463
00:32:50,354 --> 00:32:52,564
- God.
- Jeez.

464
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:56,485
Hey. Somebody?

465
00:32:56,652 --> 00:32:59,571
<i>- Billy, you back from the crapper yet?</i>
- Let me out of here.

466
00:32:59,738 --> 00:33:03,742
- I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.
<i>- The alarm's going off. Check it out. </i>

467
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:05,786
<i>Billy?</i>

468
00:33:06,036 --> 00:33:08,289
<i>- Billy?</i>
- Jimmy?

469
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:09,748
Help!

470
00:33:24,013 --> 00:33:26,682
- Come on, let me try.
- How is it gonna be any different?

471
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,600
- Can I just try it?
- Fine, go ahead.

472
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:31,145
Jesus. Okay.

473
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:33,355
All right.

474
00:33:39,486 --> 00:33:43,240
Yeah, baby. See?
Eat it. Okay, I'm the king.

475
00:33:43,407 --> 00:33:45,117
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm the king.

476
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,873
No. No, no. That didn't sound good.

477
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,419
Oh, God.

478
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,422
Well, this thing's
not going anywhere.

479
00:33:58,589 --> 00:34:02,301
We're not cooking
in my damn driveway, I'll tell you that.

480
00:34:07,473 --> 00:34:09,266
God.

481
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,977
What part of "slow it down"
did you not understand?

482
00:34:12,144 --> 00:34:16,231
What are you talking...? I'm...
It's heavy, man. It got away from me.

483
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:19,526
Okay. All right.
Now, that's good, that's good.

484
00:34:19,693 --> 00:34:21,820
Now just bring it up, bring it up.

485
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,074
Easy, easy, easy. Okay.

486
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:28,744
Your real estate agent,
when is she supposed to come back?

487
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:30,371
Oh, shit.

488
00:34:30,537 --> 00:34:32,957
Yeah. I don't know.

489
00:34:33,123 --> 00:34:34,708
I'll make damn sure she doesn't.

490
00:34:37,586 --> 00:34:39,797
Good call, yo.

491
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:17,501
Keep the temperature steady
at 425 degrees.

492
00:35:19,044 --> 00:35:21,255
We'll need to run it two more hours...

493
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,924
...to have enough to make
4 and a half pounds.

494
00:35:24,091 --> 00:35:26,218
Four and a half, not four?

495
00:35:26,385 --> 00:35:29,430
2 pounds pays, two go back.

496
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,143
4 and a half pounds
puts us $44,000 ahead.

497
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,271
- Each.
- Right on, man.

498
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:38,731
Right on.

499
00:35:38,897 --> 00:35:41,608
With the amount of methylamine
that we got last night...

500
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,820
...we can make
4 and a half pounds a week for...

501
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:47,489
...well, for the foreseeable future.

502
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,285
How long is that gonna be?

503
00:35:52,244 --> 00:35:55,623
I mean, in your situation.

504
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,250
How much cash do you need?

505
00:35:59,877 --> 00:36:01,420
More.

506
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:08,927
Someone's in the yard.

507
00:36:10,095 --> 00:36:13,182
Yeah, this is definitely the one.

508
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:14,683
It's pretty.

509
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,978
Actually, I like it.

510
00:36:18,145 --> 00:36:20,189
We could pull that out
and put in a closet.

511
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:23,150
Just a little...
We'll have to bring that down.

512
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,111
I thought you didn't like
that type of thing.

513
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:28,989
Oh, no. No, I don't.

514
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,492
Right, right.

515
00:36:35,788 --> 00:36:40,501
Was there, by any chance, scheduled
for this afternoon, an open house?

516
00:36:40,668 --> 00:36:44,129
- I left her a message. It's not my fault.
- I don't care how you do it...

517
00:36:44,296 --> 00:36:46,674
...just keep them out of here.
Do you understand?

518
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,634
- Yeah.
- All right, go.

519
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:12,324
Absolutely.

520
00:37:17,997 --> 00:37:19,999
You know, you can't duck me forever.

521
00:37:20,165 --> 00:37:21,458
What?

522
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,877
Come on, I left you, like,
15 messages.

523
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:26,547
When I went to your office,
you snuck out the back.

524
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:29,633
I didn't sneak. I was going to lunch.

525
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,844
Skyler, what are you,
the paranoid police?

526
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:36,348
You know what, Marie? Marie, I have
never been so humiliated in my life.

527
00:37:36,515 --> 00:37:38,142
That...

528
00:37:38,934 --> 00:37:41,979
That tiara.

529
00:37:42,146 --> 00:37:46,191
They accused me, at Zachary's,
of shoplifting it.

530
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:48,819
What were you doing at Zachary's?

531
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,447
I was returning it.

532
00:37:52,197 --> 00:37:54,533
You were returning it.

533
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,744
Why would you return it?

534
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:59,330
It just wasn't...

535
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:03,584
Marie, what is wrong with you?
Can you please tell me that?

536
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:06,879
Can you tell me
why you'd do such a thing?

537
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:13,302
What does that mean?
Does that mean you don't know?

538
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:20,643
That... means that I have no idea
what the hell you're even talking about.

539
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:23,854
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

540
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:25,606
The shop...

541
00:38:26,523 --> 00:38:29,652
The shoplifting. No idea?

542
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:34,657
You're not going to admit this,
are you?

543
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:39,161
I can't really admit to something...

544
00:38:39,328 --> 00:38:43,207
...when I have no knowledge
of what it is that I'm admitting.

545
00:38:59,848 --> 00:39:02,351
- Would you like that gift-wrapped?
- Yes, actually.

546
00:39:02,518 --> 00:39:04,728
Don't forget to sign in.

547
00:39:10,484 --> 00:39:12,069
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

548
00:39:14,238 --> 00:39:16,031
You're right.

549
00:39:17,032 --> 00:39:19,326
Look at this wall here.

550
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:33,215
Excuse me,
I'd just like to see the basement.

551
00:39:33,382 --> 00:39:36,635
- Yeah, well, it's occupied.
- It's not a bathroom.

552
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:40,014
I just want to see the basement.
What's the big deal?

553
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,974
You ain't seeing the basement, bitch.

554
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:45,144
You got that? Is that sinking in?
Now, beat it.

555
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,479
All you all, house is not for sale.

556
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,732
Get the hell out.

557
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:31,398
- Hey.
- Hey.

558
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:36,028
So how was it?

559
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:40,366
Was it an experience?

560
00:40:40,532 --> 00:40:42,034
Yeah.

561
00:40:42,201 --> 00:40:45,120
It was definitely an experience.

562
00:40:51,251 --> 00:40:52,670
What's that smell?

563
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,799
Oh, yeah, it's...

564
00:40:56,966 --> 00:40:59,677
...sacred Navajo herbs.

565
00:40:59,843 --> 00:41:01,595
You know.

566
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:17,361
Hey, everything okay?

567
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:19,071
No.

568
00:41:19,238 --> 00:41:21,031
Not really.

569
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:24,702
Actually, not at all.

570
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,874
You know that tiara
that Marie gave us?

571
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:36,755
- Yeah.
- Well, she stole it. Yep.

572
00:41:36,922 --> 00:41:40,926
I practically got arrested
trying to return it at the store.

573
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,469
Oh, my God.

574
00:41:42,636 --> 00:41:46,682
I mean, she refuses to admit it.
She refuses to apologise.

575
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:48,934
I don't know what to do.

576
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:59,320
People sometimes
do things for their families.

577
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:05,034
People sometimes
do things for their families?

578
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,203
And what, that justifies stealing?

579
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,290
Well...

580
00:42:12,249 --> 00:42:15,127
That must've been
some sweat lodge.

581
00:42:15,878 --> 00:42:19,423
Are you even listening to the words
coming out of your mouth?

582
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:25,679
What would you do if it were me?

583
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:29,933
What do you mean, if it were you?

584
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:34,313
If it were me, what would you do?
Would you divorce me?

585
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,317
Would you turn me in to the police?

586
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,912
You don't want to find out.

587
00:43:01,298 --> 00:43:03,342
You want something to eat?

588
00:43:07,054 --> 00:43:09,014
No, thanks.

589
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:28,242
What is this shit? This is blue.

590
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:33,706
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

591
00:43:33,872 --> 00:43:36,834
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

592
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,511
Tight, tight, tight, yeah.

593
00:43:48,012 --> 00:43:51,598
Blue, yellow, pink. Whatever, man.
Just keep bringing me that.

594
00:44:01,942 --> 00:44:03,944
4.6.

595
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,488
Come on.

596
00:44:07,573 --> 00:44:10,826
And what'd I say, man?
This guy can cook.

597
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:12,953
You're all right, man. You're all right.

598
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,748
We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

599
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,710
Just remember
who you're working for.

600
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:24,048
What did you say?

601
00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:27,259
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

602
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,970
Like they don't already know that?

603
00:44:30,971 --> 00:44:33,849
Are you saying that they're stupid?

604
00:44:34,725 --> 00:44:37,311
No, I'm just... I'm just saying.

605
00:44:37,478 --> 00:44:40,105
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid.

606
00:44:40,272 --> 00:44:42,900
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

607
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:46,028
No, come on, Tuco. I'm just...
I'm just saying.

608
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:48,030
No, you're just speaking for me!

609
00:44:48,197 --> 00:44:52,451
Like I ain't got the goddamn sense
to speak for myself!

610
00:44:52,826 --> 00:44:56,080
Is that it? Is that what you're doing?

611
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,040
Tuco.

612
00:44:58,207 --> 00:44:59,583
Tuco.

613
00:45:01,001 --> 00:45:05,005
Hey, why don't we all just relax, huh?

614
00:45:12,012 --> 00:45:15,265

I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed.

616
00:45:24,108 --> 00:45:25,359

Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

618
00:45:47,464 --> 00:45:49,508
That is messed up.

619
00:45:50,968 --> 00:45:53,470
Okay, Heisenberg.

1
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:07,875
Operation Icebreaker.

2
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:13,088
- How we liking that?
- We never used that before, did we?

3
00:00:13,297 --> 00:00:15,424
- Isn't that the name of a breath mint?
- What?

4
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:18,719
- Ice Breakers, right? Breath mint?
- Nobody's gonna think that.

5
00:00:18,927 --> 00:00:21,805
Gonna be thinking about some ship
in the North Pole breaking ice.

6
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,892
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,896
I'm thinking Operation Breath Mint every
time you and me are on a stakeout.

8
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:31,690
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit waggon.

9
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:36,278
All right, Operation TBD.

10
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:37,613
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

11
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:42,159
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

12
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:46,121
A.k. a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,917
I turned him out when he was street,
but this dude's like <i>The Jeffersons... </i>

14
00:00:50,125 --> 00:00:52,544
...moving on up.
- Every dealer he'd throw at us...

15
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:56,715
...he'd end up snaking their customers.
- Turns out he's missing, presumed dead.

16
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:59,134
Found his car out in the boonies.

17
00:00:59,343 --> 00:01:03,430
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin...

18
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,349
...Emilio Koyama.

19
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:07,976
You thinking the cousin found out
and took revenge?

20
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:10,813
Could be, turns out he's missing too.

21
00:01:11,021 --> 00:01:14,358
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favour.

22
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:18,445
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it...

23
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:20,656
...we take it to the lab,
they come back...

24
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:23,617
...they tell us it the purest
they've ever seen.

25
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:25,452
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

26
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:28,205
Our chemist is blown away.
Said he couldn't do better.

27
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:31,416
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico...

28
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:34,753
...we're thinking this was cooked
here in the Land of Enchantment.

29
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:38,423
Car was abandoned
at what appears to be a cook site.

30
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,093
This is the only other thing
left behind.

31
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:44,763
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

32
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:49,977
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

33
00:01:51,436 --> 00:01:52,604
So be on notice.

34
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,108
We got new players in town.

35
00:01:56,942 --> 00:02:00,445
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from...

36
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,073
...but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

37
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:05,451
<i>Me, personally... </i>

38
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:09,872
<i>...I'm thinking Albuquerque</i>
<i>just might have a new kingpin. </i>

39
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:47,152
Jesus, Walt,
you're burning the shit out of them.

40
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,237
Damn it.

41
00:02:49,446 --> 00:02:51,865
Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?

42
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:54,034
Emeril, here,
is gonna need a fresh pack.

43
00:02:56,203 --> 00:02:57,454
All right, looking good.

44
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:00,373
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the coleslaw?

45
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,627
I don't know, it's store-bought.

46
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,630
Okay, Hank, you need another beer?

47
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,423
Does the pope shit in his hat?

48
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:12,344
Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank,
and I think everybody would like it...

49
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:13,929
...if you'd stop saying that.

50
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,348
- Marie, some more wine?
- I'm all right, thanks.

51
00:03:16,556 --> 00:03:18,308
- All right.
- Hey, I want a beer.

52
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:21,603
Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

53
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:23,688
Guess what. It ain't happening either.

54
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:25,982
- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

55
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,151
Honey, do you need anything?

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,988
- No, Walt, thank you.
- Okay. Be right back.

57
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:54,344
- No.
- What, are you kidding me?

58
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:56,805
You look like
a damn movie star, man.

59
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,516
Girls gotta be lining up left and right.

60
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,561
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

61
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,522
He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable,
he wants to be hot.

62
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,275
See what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

63
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:12,445
- She's supposed to say that.
- Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like...

64
00:04:12,654 --> 00:04:15,824
...you know, Charlton Heston...
I'm talking Moses days.

65
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:19,619
- To get a girl, all right?
You just gotta have...

66
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:22,038
...confidence.

67
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,875
Confidence and persistence.

68
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:27,335
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

69
00:04:27,544 --> 00:04:30,046
I chased your aunt Marie, here,
all over creation.

70
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:32,966
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

71
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:34,801
What, I asked you, like, 50 times?

72
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,847
Yeah, it was before they tightened
the stalking laws.

73
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:43,852
Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

74
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,773
- Tell him how you met Skylar.
- Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos...

75
00:04:48,982 --> 00:04:52,652
...and Dad said that thing to you.

76
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:55,989
Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress...

77
00:04:56,198 --> 00:05:00,368
...it was a summer job,
and she was the hostess...

78
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:03,163
...and she also worked
the cash register.

79
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:07,042
And I used to go in there a lot because
it was close enough to the lab...

80
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,045
...where I could ride my bicycle.

81
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,756
And once I noticed her...

82
00:05:13,298 --> 00:05:18,345
...it got to be so that I would only go in
when I knew she was working.

83
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:21,640
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter...

84
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:26,269
...doing her crossword puzzles,
but kind of hiding it...

85
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,647
...pretending that
she was still working...

86
00:05:28,855 --> 00:05:30,982
...and once I caught on to that...

87
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:35,070
...I would do crossword puzzles while
I ate my grilled-cheese sandwich.

88
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:37,948
It got so that every day at lunch...

89
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:41,409
...we would both be doing
<i>The New York Times</i> crossword puzzle...

90
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:44,204
...10 feet from each other.

91
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:48,625
And eventually...

92
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:52,003
...I caught her looking over at me...

93
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:55,090
...so I began saying:

94
00:05:55,298 --> 00:06:01,137
"Excuse me, 14 across,
seven-letter word for whatchamacallit...

95
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:04,808
...may I ask what you wrote down?"

96
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:09,187
And, well, that got us talking...

97
00:06:09,396 --> 00:06:13,733
...and, boy, I tell you,
I was terrible at those puzzles.

98
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:17,654
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

99
00:06:17,863 --> 00:06:21,032
But your mother
would do them in ink.

100
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,367
Very smooth.

101
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:26,288
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

102
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,624
But that's what I'm talking about,
that's persistence, you see?

103
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,877
Once you set your cap
for something...

104
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:35,589
...or somebody,
you gotta just, you know...

105
00:06:37,883 --> 00:06:41,720
- Skylar.
- Mom, are you all right?

106
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,055
Hey, hey.

107
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:46,057
Honey, it's okay.

108
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:48,268
What's the matter?

109
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:53,190
What is it?

110
00:06:54,191 --> 00:06:56,318
Ask him.

111
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:07,829
What's she talking about?

112
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:13,960
Walt?

113
00:07:21,468 --> 00:07:23,720
I have cancer.

114
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:29,601
Lung cancer.

115
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,279
It's bad.

116
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,594
<i>Ask him how long he's known. </i>

117
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:10,016
- I guess a month, maybe.
- Oh, for God sakes, Walt.

118
00:08:10,225 --> 00:08:13,520
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on.

119
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:16,273
He made me promise
not to tell anybody.

120
00:08:16,648 --> 00:08:20,110
Christ, these last 48 hours.

121
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,781
And it's the weekend, so I couldn't
even get his doctor on the phone.

122
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:27,993
Buddy, why...? I mean, why wouldn't
you wanna tell anybody?

123
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:33,999
Walt, don't you see
everybody just wants to help you.

124
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:38,253
We're family.
We get through these things together.

125
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:43,008
And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?
How can that happen?

126
00:08:43,216 --> 00:08:45,760
- You don't even smoke.
- You know, I'm thinking...

127
00:08:45,969 --> 00:08:47,888
...that this goes back 20 years,
maybe...

128
00:08:48,096 --> 00:08:51,725
...to the applications lab, all those
chemicals they had you working around.

129
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,186
We always took
the proper precautions.

130
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:57,689
One time you complained that
they didn't give you the right kind of...

131
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:01,151
...I don't know, some kind of
ventilation hood or something...

132
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:04,196
...and then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

133
00:09:04,404 --> 00:09:06,740
How do they think
they can get away with this?

134
00:09:06,948 --> 00:09:12,871
- We should hire a lawyer.
- Okay, so first let's deal with this.

135
00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,958
Okay, so,
what's the next step for Walt?

136
00:09:17,167 --> 00:09:20,212
Certainly a second opinion, right?

137
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,964
Right. Right, absolutely.

138
00:09:23,173 --> 00:09:27,511
Okay, so first thing tomorrow,
I talk to my radiologists...

139
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:33,892
...we find you the best,
the oncology dream team.

140
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,020
That's good. That's good.

141
00:09:37,229 --> 00:09:38,814
Yeah.

142
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:42,067
Yeah?

143
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:44,194
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

144
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:45,779
Yeah.

145
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:53,829
I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.

146
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,665
I'm gonna see...

147
00:09:56,873 --> 00:10:00,418
...if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

148
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,881
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

149
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,806
Walt...

150
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:16,101
...whatever happens...

151
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:19,980
...I hope this goes without saying...

152
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:22,274
...but whatever happens...

153
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:25,110
...I want you to know that...

154
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,489
...I'll always take care of your family.

155
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:59,895
Yo, check out these fake Pop-Tarts.

156
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:02,731
- These are mad tight, yo.
- No, thanks, man, pass.

157
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,735
Your loss. These are from, like,
Canada, or something. Imported.

158
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:08,987
Hey, yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

159
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:12,866
- Did, like, the ceiling fall down, or?
- Oh, yeah...

160
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:16,369
...no, man,
I think the house is just settling.

161
00:11:16,578 --> 00:11:18,747
You know,
it's been caving in left and right.

162
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:20,707
Hit me in the eye.

163
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,627
- It's bananas.
- Yo, my pops could fix you up...

164
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:26,171
...he's, like,
a contractor or something.

165
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,715
Yeah? Yeah, right on,
I should grab that number.

166
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:31,551
Say, Jesse,
you still cook a little crystal?

167
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,476
Could be, yeah.
You know, from time to time.

168
00:11:39,684 --> 00:11:42,479
I heard you lost your partner.

169
00:11:42,687 --> 00:11:43,939
Emilio.

170
00:11:45,524 --> 00:11:46,775
Didn't he get locked up?

171
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,569
No, man, he's out.
His cousin bailed him out.

172
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,696
I think he skipped town
or something.

173
00:11:51,905 --> 00:11:54,199
I don't know about any of that,
I've just been...

174
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,660
...kind of doing my own thing
these days, so...

175
00:11:56,868 --> 00:11:59,412
But you maybe
got some crystal, man?

176
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:03,416
Because I could seriously go for a bowl
right now, you know, take the edge off.

177
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:07,796
- Hell, yeah, Sunday night bowl, yo.
- All right.

178
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:14,386
Well, maybe it just so happens...

179
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:18,139
...that I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

180
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:20,725
Yeah?

181
00:12:21,268 --> 00:12:23,478
Oh, yeah. Came up
with this whole new recipe.

182
00:12:23,687 --> 00:12:25,730
It's more like a formula.

183
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:30,277
It's, like,
way, way more chemically...

184
00:12:30,485 --> 00:12:33,321
Shit, you know,
it's just the bomb, so...

185
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:37,617
But, you know, I don't know,
I've been thinking lately...

186
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:39,786
...I'll just lay off of it for a while...

187
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:42,956
...because lately it's been
kind of making me paranoid, so...

188
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:51,047
You know, for, like,
health-wise, just lay off.

189
00:12:51,256 --> 00:12:55,677
Yo, if you're not into sharing, man,
just tell us to piss off, it's cool.

190
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:58,305
- We don't need no soap opera.
- Yeah, man, whatever.

191
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,348
No, no, it's all good, you know.

192
00:13:00,557 --> 00:13:04,728
I'm just saying,
hey, I got plenty of pot.

193
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:07,189
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

194
00:13:07,397 --> 00:13:09,566
Yeah, sounds about right.

195
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:14,070
Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes, I'm joking.

196
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,240
Okay, I'm totally joking with you.

197
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:20,035
You kidding? Sit down.

198
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,336
Best scante ever.

199
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:30,587
Grab that pipe.

200
00:16:24,761 --> 00:16:25,762
Okay, there.

201
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:35,105
Shit.

202
00:16:45,574 --> 00:16:49,035
Walt, do you need some help?

203
00:16:51,121 --> 00:16:56,668
Oh, no, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine.
Just privacy.

204
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:58,587
Thanks.

205
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:03,383
I'm right outside if you need me.

206
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,302
Okay.

207
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,311
Yeah, any time on Friday
is absolutely fine.

208
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:17,314
Thank you so much
for working us in.

209
00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:22,402
Can I just put that on a credit card?

210
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:24,654
Great. Perfect.

211
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:29,951
Okay, so we will see you at 10:45
on Friday morning.

212
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,704
Thank you so much.

213
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:34,498
Okay.

214
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,460
Oh, yes.

215
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:39,753
Honey...

216
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:43,673
...the best oncologist, I mean,
not even just in New Mexico...

217
00:17:43,882 --> 00:17:46,968
...but one of the top 10
in the entire nation...

218
00:17:47,177 --> 00:17:50,388
...his name is Dr. Delcavoli...

219
00:17:50,597 --> 00:17:52,724
...and we see him on Friday.

220
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,813
I mean,
Marie really came through for us.

221
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:00,023
She had her boss call, and...

222
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:06,780
Okay, this is good.

223
00:18:07,531 --> 00:18:09,241
From here on out, things are gonna...

224
00:18:09,449 --> 00:18:11,827
What's that we're putting on
a credit card?

225
00:18:12,035 --> 00:18:15,163
It's just a deposit kind of thing.

226
00:18:15,622 --> 00:18:19,543
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5000.

227
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:21,461
Five thousand?

228
00:18:24,381 --> 00:18:25,882
Jesus.

229
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:30,720
What's that, just to start? I mean...

230
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:33,098
...just to tell me
what I already know?

231
00:18:33,306 --> 00:18:35,809
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

232
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:38,854
So be it, we'll figure it out.

233
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:43,692
Come on,
don't get hung up on money here.

234
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,404
- We can always borrow from Hank.
- Absolutely not.

235
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,616
No, I just...

236
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,702
We're not gonna do that.

237
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,079
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

238
00:18:58,665 --> 00:19:00,542
Have you even called her yet?

239
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:06,506
Walt, regardless, you're gonna have to
tell her about this...

240
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:09,759
...I mean, I'm willing to do it, but I...
- I'll call. I'll call.

241
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:12,137
Okay, look...

242
00:19:13,013 --> 00:19:16,766
...I don't even want us
thinking about money.

243
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:18,977
Money is not the issue here.

244
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:21,813
- It's not.
- I know. I know.

245
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,400
It's not.

246
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:27,027
- Okay.
- Okay.

247
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:28,862
Okay.

248
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:32,032
I'll take care of the deposit.

249
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,825
Yeah?

250
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:35,911
Yeah.

251
00:19:37,913 --> 00:19:40,624
I'll borrow it from my pension.

252
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:12,405
Damn it!

253
00:20:15,242 --> 00:20:18,703
Hey. Hey, pal, what's up?

254
00:20:21,331 --> 00:20:24,292
Oh, yeah, no, I thought I heard mice.

255
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:27,629
Boy, that's all we need, huh?

256
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:31,341
So, what's up, pal?

257
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,135
What the hell's wrong with you?

258
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,226
- What?
- You're acting all...

259
00:20:41,434 --> 00:20:43,270
You're...

260
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:49,192
You're all...
Why are you acting so weird?

261
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:53,071
- Son.
- You're acting like nothing is going on.

262
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,960
Oh, no, please. Please, please, no.

263
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:42,305
Hey, no, hey!

264
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,142
- Hey!
- Put that douche bag on the phone.

265
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,393
Oh, come on.

266
00:22:46,601 --> 00:22:50,605
Hey, am I gonna have to
come down there and whup your ass?

267
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:07,455
And let me tell you something else,
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

268
00:23:07,664 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm the best he's got.
He knows it, I know it...

269
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:13,587
...I expect to be paid to a level
commensurate with...

270
00:23:13,795 --> 00:23:16,715
I said, " Dave, do you think 40 grand
is a proper bonus?"

271
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:20,010
That's less than 10 percent
of what I booked this quarter.

272
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:22,345
I'm not gonna sit here
and be disrespect...

273
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:24,681
Oh, he's shitting bricks.

274
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,266
Oh, you know he is.

275
00:23:26,475 --> 00:23:28,894
Yeah, that man lives in fear.
I'll go across town...

276
00:23:29,102 --> 00:23:30,437
Hell, I could go anywhere.

277
00:23:30,645 --> 00:23:32,647
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher.

278
00:23:32,856 --> 00:23:36,693
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me
a partner for walking in the damn door...

279
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:39,237
...that's how ecstatic they'd be.
- Next customer.

280
00:23:39,446 --> 00:23:41,615
Hells, yes, brother man.

281
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:44,951
Dude, you should check this chick out.

282
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,829
Who? No.

283
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:49,956
Buddy, she's a cow.

284
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,958
Stacey's a cow.

285
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:55,170
We're talking major
barnyard boo-hog.

286
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:59,508
Roll her in flour and look for
the wet spot before you hit that, man.

287
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:02,427
That kind of stink does not wash off.

288
00:24:02,636 --> 00:24:05,013
- Sir?
- Right.

289
00:24:05,222 --> 00:24:06,890
Sir.

290
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:08,892
Oh, yeah?

291
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,186
- Sorry. Hi.
- Oh, totally.

292
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:13,522
- Hi. What can I do for you today?
- Which dude?

293
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,149
- That dude that looks like a lizard?
- Next in line.

294
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:19,903
- And he limps like some leper.
- I'm sorry, I would like...

295
00:24:20,111 --> 00:24:22,072
...a cashier's cheque...
- Grosses me out.

296
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,490
...in the full amount...

297
00:24:23,698 --> 00:24:28,495
...made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

298
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:33,583
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

299
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,669
Yeah, you got it.

300
00:24:37,712 --> 00:24:39,840
I don't understand
why they're forcing you...

301
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,800
...to choose between
piccolo and oboe.

302
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:43,802
You show so much promise
with both.

303
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,346
They can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

304
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:49,391
No matter how they divide it up,
someone would be left out.

305
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,769
- Rules are rules, I guess.
- Sure, rules are rules. I'm all for that.

306
00:24:52,978 --> 00:24:56,148
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

307
00:24:56,356 --> 00:24:58,775
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

308
00:24:58,984 --> 00:25:00,652
Thanks.

309
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:02,404
What about Mr. Pemberton?

310
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:04,823
Is he giving you enough
individual attention?

311
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:07,325
I'd say so.
He tries to talk to each one of us...

312
00:25:07,534 --> 00:25:09,619
...at least once during every practise.

313
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:13,665
- That's good. Feedback's important.
- It's key, I think.

314
00:25:14,249 --> 00:25:17,169
Hey, so how was soccer practise?

315
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,424
I think that was in our backyard.

316
00:25:31,349 --> 00:25:32,642
Who's there?

317
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:41,735
What the hell are you doing out here?

318
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,072
Hey, Dad.

319
00:25:47,657 --> 00:25:48,992
Hey, Mom.

320
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:51,036
Jake.

321
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:53,955
Got new patio furniture.

322
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:56,708
Right on.

323
00:25:59,794 --> 00:26:01,463
My leg.

324
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:07,863
What do you think it could be?

325
00:27:09,406 --> 00:27:11,616
God knows I'm no expert.

326
00:27:11,825 --> 00:27:15,453
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

327
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:19,249
I think we should check his arms
for needle marks.

328
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,837
Do we let him stay?

329
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,133
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

330
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:32,012
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

331
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:35,932
I just don't know what to tell Jake.

332
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:46,985
- Hey.
- Hey. Good evening.

333
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:49,905
Well? Sleep well?

334
00:27:50,489 --> 00:27:53,533
What time's...? What time is dinner?

335
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:57,120
In about an hour.

336
00:28:00,123 --> 00:28:03,084
You know,
I could wash those clothes if you like.

337
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:05,253
They look a little lived in.

338
00:28:06,505 --> 00:28:09,966
No, that's cool. Maybe later.

339
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:16,181
We are not doing this again.

340
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:18,183
No.

341
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:21,520
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

342
00:28:21,728 --> 00:28:24,648
We just have to be
consistent about it.

343
00:29:10,485 --> 00:29:12,028
Hey.

344
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:16,825
You're not taking the bus?

345
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:22,414
All right. Well, listen.

346
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:26,126
Give me maybe another 20 minutes,
and we'll get out of here.

347
00:29:26,334 --> 00:29:29,671
- All right.
- All right.

348
00:29:30,422 --> 00:29:32,174
Yeah, good.

349
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:06,458
You know, I just think that...

350
00:30:09,711 --> 00:30:13,089
...things have a way
of working themselves out.

351
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:39,950
When did you get this?

352
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:42,369
Last May at the year-end assembly.

353
00:30:42,577 --> 00:30:45,497
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

354
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:50,418
Environmental Consciousness
Award.

355
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:54,422
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

356
00:30:54,673 --> 00:30:56,424
I contacted
<i>The Albuquerque Journal... </i>

357
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:59,427
...and asked what chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

358
00:30:59,636 --> 00:31:02,722
- Wound up writing an article about it.
- Right on, little bro.

359
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:05,767
Making mad inroads
with the business community.

360
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:07,519
All right.

361
00:31:07,727 --> 00:31:09,479
Now, hey, remember...

362
00:31:09,688 --> 00:31:13,483
...not all learning
comes out of books.

363
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:18,947
Look at you.

364
00:31:19,656 --> 00:31:22,117
You know, we should...
We should hang out more often.

365
00:31:22,325 --> 00:31:26,496
You know, just kick back and chill.

366
00:31:26,746 --> 00:31:31,793
I mean, if you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

367
00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:35,922
Because, you know, I've been...
I've been through it all. For real.

368
00:31:39,176 --> 00:31:42,804
Yeah, man, you... You play the flute?

369
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:47,517
- It's a piccolo, actually.
- Dude, play some Jethro Tull.

370
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,315
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?

371
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:56,234
We're good.

372
00:31:57,861 --> 00:32:00,572
- Jake?
- Yeah. Fine, Mom.

373
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,452
Well, that's good. That's great.

374
00:32:13,043 --> 00:32:16,755
You know, what the hell?
You see this?

375
00:32:17,464 --> 00:32:19,216
What am I,
some criminal or something?

376
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:22,969
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

377
00:32:23,178 --> 00:32:25,430
What, you think that's okay?

378
00:32:25,639 --> 00:32:31,061
Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag
warp the mind of our favourite son. "

379
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:32,729
I'm the favourite?

380
00:32:34,022 --> 00:32:35,732
Yeah, right.

381
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:38,109
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

382
00:34:15,499 --> 00:34:18,627
Oh, snap.

383
00:34:19,711 --> 00:34:21,671
Awesome.

384
00:34:54,496 --> 00:34:56,998
- Yeah?
<i>- Yo, man, it's me.</i>

385
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:00,919
Hey, listen. You know that product?

386
00:35:01,127 --> 00:35:02,838
You got any more of that?

387
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:05,131
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

388
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,634
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

389
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:09,594
<i>No, no charity. No. </i>

390
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:12,139
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

391
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:15,100
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

392
00:35:15,308 --> 00:35:18,770
And your stuff is, like, so sweet.

393
00:35:18,979 --> 00:35:20,689
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

394
00:35:21,398 --> 00:35:23,275
You up for making some fat stacks?

395
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:25,735
Because they'll buy
everything you got.

396
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:39,457
Yes. Yes. Okay.

397
00:35:45,213 --> 00:35:47,340
Oh, you can't be serious.

398
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:50,552
What the hell are you doing here?

399
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,432
Yo, I waited till the ball buster left.
I mean, no offence.

400
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,977
Who sent you, huh?

401
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:00,687
- You wearing a wire?
- Hey. Jesus.

402
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,439
- You setting me up?
- Homo.

403
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:04,483
A wire? You want a wire?

404
00:36:04,691 --> 00:36:07,444
I got a wire.
Speak into the mike, bitch.

405
00:36:07,652 --> 00:36:09,154
What the hell's wrong with you?

406
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:11,198
A wire.

407
00:36:11,406 --> 00:36:12,657
Jesus.

408
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:17,287
- So who did you tell about?
- Nobody. What, are you nuts?

409
00:36:17,496 --> 00:36:19,915
Then why are you here?

410
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:23,585
I don't know.

411
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:27,047
To, like, touch base.

412
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:28,798
Touch base?

413
00:36:30,008 --> 00:36:32,010
Yeah, you know.

414
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:35,847
What they call a debrief.

415
00:36:36,056 --> 00:36:37,766
Maybe we could, like...

416
00:36:37,974 --> 00:36:39,726
Thought we could debrief.

417
00:36:39,935 --> 00:36:41,770
Debrief?

418
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:43,772
Wow, that's...

419
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,150
That's what you think we need,
debrief?

420
00:36:49,277 --> 00:36:53,406
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

421
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:55,575
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

422
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:58,620
I mean, we can't talk to anybody else.

423
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:02,874
Anyway, that and I wanted to...

424
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:04,209
Wanted to, you know...

425
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:08,338
...tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

426
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:12,592
Everybody digs the meth we cooked.

427
00:37:13,635 --> 00:37:19,683
Seriously. I got dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

428
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:23,061
- Great.
- I'm just saying, I mean, if you ever...

429
00:37:23,937 --> 00:37:25,981
...you know, saw your way clear...

430
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:32,946
...to, you know,
you and I cooking a little more...

431
00:37:41,037 --> 00:37:42,789
Get the hell off my property.

432
00:37:42,998 --> 00:37:45,750
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go. And don't come back.

433
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:47,961
Now.

434
00:37:50,005 --> 00:37:51,381
All right.

435
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:53,675
All right, you know what?

436
00:37:53,884 --> 00:37:55,886
Four grand.

437
00:37:56,845 --> 00:38:00,474
Your share from selling that batch.

438
00:38:01,016 --> 00:38:03,351
That's why I'm here.

439
00:38:03,727 --> 00:38:07,939
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Hey, I didn't smoke it all.

440
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:35,383
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

441
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:40,305
Stage 3A, which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

442
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:42,974
There's no denying it's very serious.

443
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,811
But it... Is it...?

444
00:38:46,436 --> 00:38:48,188
It is...

445
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,357
...curable?

446
00:38:51,024 --> 00:38:53,443
I prefer the word "treatable. "

447
00:38:53,902 --> 00:38:56,988
But the treatments we have
at our disposal can be very effective.

448
00:38:57,197 --> 00:39:00,575
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that the specific course...

449
00:39:00,784 --> 00:39:04,788
...of radiation and chemotherapy I'm
going to suggest has been successful.

450
00:39:04,996 --> 00:39:09,334
In certain cases, it's prolonged a
patient's life and resulted in remission.

451
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:13,713
What about the side effects?

452
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:17,425
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

453
00:39:17,634 --> 00:39:19,511
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

454
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:23,348
It varies from patient to patient.
Typically, there's hair loss...

455
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:27,352
...which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

456
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:30,856
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

457
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,858
You won't want to get out of bed.

458
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:37,112
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

459
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,490
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

460
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:44,536
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea...

461
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:48,373
...although we'll prescribe an
antiemetic and try to counteract that.

462
00:39:48,582 --> 00:39:50,375
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.

463
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:53,044
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

464
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:59,301
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry...

465
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,498
Got anything to say?

466
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:37,589
What do you know about that?

467
00:40:39,257 --> 00:40:41,885
- Nothing.
- Well, that's not gonna fly this time.

468
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:44,846
How many chances
have we given you?

469
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,890
How many times have we
sat right here...

470
00:40:47,098 --> 00:40:49,559
...and had the same conversation
over and over again?

471
00:40:49,768 --> 00:40:52,229
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

472
00:40:52,437 --> 00:40:54,022
And you play on our emotions...

473
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:57,400
...and tell us anything and everything
you think we want to hear...

474
00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:00,195
...just so we'll give you
another chance.

475
00:41:00,403 --> 00:41:04,699
And it makes us feel like fools.
Every time.

476
00:41:08,745 --> 00:41:10,997
Enough, Jesse.

477
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:12,499
Enough.

478
00:41:13,959 --> 00:41:16,628
We are not going to have this
in our house.

479
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:20,590
We need you to leave.

480
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:02,215
Thanks for not telling on me.

481
00:42:07,053 --> 00:42:09,431
You think I could have it back?

482
00:42:23,904 --> 00:42:26,323
It's skunk-weed anyway.

483
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:47,344
<i>The Air Force is aware</i>
<i>of the widely-held belief... </i>

484
00:42:47,552 --> 00:42:50,013
<i>...that some of these</i>
<i>could be flying saucers from... </i>

485
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:52,474
You know,
this is actually very hopeful.

486
00:42:52,682 --> 00:42:54,392
<i>Nothing conclusive</i>
<i>in the evidence...</i>

487
00:42:54,601 --> 00:42:57,270
<i>...but probing and digesting</i>
<i>of information about UFOs... </i>

488
00:42:57,479 --> 00:42:58,939
<i>...continues unceasingly. </i>

489
00:42:59,606 --> 00:43:00,941
Did you hear me?

490
00:43:01,149 --> 00:43:04,653
I said this is really
very, very hopeful.

491
00:43:04,861 --> 00:43:08,615
<i>Defence Command in</i>
<i>Colorado Springs issued an order... </i>

492
00:43:08,824 --> 00:43:13,328
So can I call them
and tell them you'll start next week?

493
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,041
<i>Even as they did so,</i>
<i>the military wondered whether... </i>

494
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,794
<i>...their scientific know-how</i>
<i>and their best weapons... </i>

495
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:27,801
<i>...would be effective in any battle</i>
<i>of the Earth versus the flying saucers. </i>

496
00:43:28,385 --> 00:43:33,306
I just think that we need to discuss it
a little more, that's all.

497
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:35,934
What is there to discuss?

498
00:43:36,143 --> 00:43:39,604
You're gonna get the best treatment,
and he's the best.

499
00:43:39,813 --> 00:43:45,402
Well, there's the money discussion.
I think... No, $90,000 out of pocket.

500
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,445
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

501
00:43:47,654 --> 00:43:48,947
There's financing...

502
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:53,410
...there's instalment plans.
I could always go back to work.

503
00:43:53,618 --> 00:43:57,080
- Walt, there's always a way.
- All right.

504
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:00,250
Skyler, say that there is a way.

505
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,545
And we spend all that money, and...

506
00:44:15,307 --> 00:44:19,603
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

507
00:44:20,061 --> 00:44:22,564
No. Honey.

508
00:44:22,772 --> 00:44:26,318
I just don't want emotions ruling us.

509
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,946
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

510
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:34,576
Then why don't you just fucking die,
already?

511
00:44:37,746 --> 00:44:40,165
Just give up and die.

512
00:45:29,631 --> 00:45:32,092
Come on, move your ass.

513
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:35,512
Name of the guy? You'll like him.

514
00:45:37,305 --> 00:45:40,767
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.
I got the best fricking attorney.

515
00:45:40,976 --> 00:45:43,478
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one.

516
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:47,774
He's got this little team of ninjas, too,
that go out and do forward operations...

517
00:45:47,983 --> 00:45:50,110
He's got crap on people.

518
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,267
What the hell?

519
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:10,649
- What?
- Don't go near it, buddy.

520
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:14,277
What...? What are you doing?
Call somebody. Call the fire people.

521
00:47:14,486 --> 00:47:16,196
Yeah. I have a fire...

522
00:47:16,404 --> 00:47:19,199
I don't believe this.
Do you know how much I paid for that?

523
00:47:24,287 --> 00:47:26,456
Why are you doing this?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

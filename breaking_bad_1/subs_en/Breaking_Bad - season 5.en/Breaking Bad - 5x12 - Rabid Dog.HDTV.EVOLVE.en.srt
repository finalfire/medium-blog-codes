2
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:08,982
You need me gone,

3
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:11,814
'cause your brother-in-law
is never gonna let up.

4
00:00:12,042 --> 00:00:13,228
Excuse me...

5
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:22,898
<i>He a no-show?
Why didn't you c--?</i>

6
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,537
You and him-- you took it
right out of my pocket.

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,336
The ricin cigarette!

8
00:00:27,464 --> 00:00:29,032
And all for Mr. White!?

9
00:00:29,142 --> 00:00:31,950
He poisoned Brock
and you helped him!

10
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,662
Jesse!?

11
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:24,692
Jesse!

12
00:02:28,093 --> 00:02:30,335
You show yourself right now!

00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,103
I'll be in touch.

15
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:07,572
Okay. Hey, Huell.

16
00:05:07,606 --> 00:05:11,943
Listen, I want you to swing by the
high school on your way to Saul's.

17
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,829
I can't believe that he would
go after my son, but...

18
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,964
You got it.

19
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,632
And Kuby's
at the car wash, right?

20
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:19,501
Parked right across the street.

21
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:21,336
All's quiet.
No Pinkman.

22
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,421
Okay.
Just find him.

23
00:05:41,157 --> 00:05:42,907
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

24
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:47,478
Jesse, listen, uh,

25
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:50,314
I mean, obviously
you've changed your mind here,

26
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:53,001
and so thank you for that.

27
00:05:53,035 --> 00:05:55,754
And I know you're angry.

28
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,423
I wanna fix this, okay?

29
00:05:58,457 --> 00:06:01,376
Whatever it takes, all right?

30
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:05,296
We'll talk,
and we will fix this.

31
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,299
Until then, just--

32
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,335
just...
sleep it off, okay?

33
00:06:11,353 --> 00:06:13,388
And then call me.

34
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,106
Be safe.

35
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,728
How's it coming?

36
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,780
I replaced the doorjamb
and the striker plate.

37
00:06:21,814 --> 00:06:23,014
Switch this out,
we'll be good to go.

38
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:24,065
Good.

39
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,850
Oh, hey, uh,
do you want separate keys

40
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:26,868
for the different locks,

41
00:06:26,902 --> 00:06:28,536
or do you want just one
working both?

42
00:06:28,571 --> 00:06:30,622
No, no, no.
No re-key.

43
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,041
Same exact keys as before.

44
00:06:33,075 --> 00:06:34,793
Okay, it's just that
usually with a break-in,

45
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:35,960
people like to get new keys.

46
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:37,829
No, same key, same locks.

47
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:40,131
The old keys
have to work here, okay?

48
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,084
- Okay.
- All right.

49
00:06:47,512 --> 00:06:48,538
Good.

50
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,394
Good.
Good, good, good, good.

51
00:06:58,434 --> 00:06:59,484
Oh, no, no.

52
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,052
Um, hey, guys, guys, guys.

53
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,238
Cut that.
Yeah, this, uh...

54
00:07:03,272 --> 00:07:04,656
That area's still pretty bad.

55
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,025
Right, right.
We'll have to go over this a lot more.

56
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,827
Well, we've made
three passes already.

57
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:10,528
Like I say, gasoline's tricky.

58
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,197
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

59
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,865
The smell has got
to be gone completely.

60
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,366
My wife is coming home,

61
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,335
and I can't have any odor,
any stain,

62
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:19,838
any sign that anything
happened here.

63
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:22,740
Understand?

64
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:24,259
I-- I know.

65
00:07:24,293 --> 00:07:27,762
This is short notice,
and I really appreciate it.

66
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,131
Sir-- sir, we'd love
to take more of your money,

67
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:33,218
but you've got gas soaked straight
through to your subfloor.

68
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,187
Until you pull this up and
get new carpet, new padding,

69
00:07:36,222 --> 00:07:37,722
this is as good as it gets.

70
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,561
Is that gasoline?

71
00:09:57,579 --> 00:09:58,613
Ask dad.

72
00:09:58,664 --> 00:10:01,565
Hey. Over here.

73
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,251
What happened?

74
00:10:03,285 --> 00:10:05,569
What happened is that
I should sue someone.

75
00:10:05,587 --> 00:10:07,088
That's what happened.

76
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:09,173
So I'm on my way
to the drugstore,

77
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,042
and I have to stop
to get some gas,

78
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,379
and there is this
total pump malfunction.

79
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,414
You know what? She really
shouldn't be in this room at all.

80
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:19,300
I mean, this is supposedly
green, but you know how it is.

81
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:21,519
You can close the windows
in the nursery,

82
00:10:21,553 --> 00:10:24,755
because it's really
only out here.

83
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:27,525
Ugh. This is
as good as it gets.

84
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:45,827
So, um, pump malfunction?

85
00:10:45,878 --> 00:10:49,447
Yeah. So I'm standing there filling up
like I've done a thousand times before,

86
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,466
and I hear a chunk.

87
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,551
You know, the pump's nozzle.

88
00:10:53,585 --> 00:10:55,636
The-- the metal thing.
The thing you squeeze, right?

89
00:10:55,671 --> 00:11:00,425
I hear a chunk.
So I suppose, in my naivete,

90
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,176
I took to understand that gas

91
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,095
is no longer
coming out of the nozzle,

92
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,980
so I pull out the hose
to put it back

93
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,231
and whoosh!

94
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,301
You know, I am suddenly
soaked in gasoline.

95
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:14,906
I mean, on my arms
and my legs and my-- my groin.

96
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,108
So now I am in a panic,

97
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:19,911
and I race home,
I run inside the house,

98
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,580
and I'm stripping off
my clothes as fast as I can.

99
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:23,831
I jump in the shower.

100
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not until after
I get out of the shower

101
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:29,670
that I realize
my gas-covered clothes

102
00:11:29,705 --> 00:11:32,373
have been soaking
in the living room rug

103
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:33,925
this entire time.

104
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,927
I mean, it's-- it's--

105
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:38,179
the whole thing
is just so stupid.

106
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:40,498
I could have rinsed off
at the station.

107
00:11:40,516 --> 00:11:42,666
Halfway home,
I'm starting to realize--

108
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:44,135
wait a minute--
there's a water hose

109
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:46,721
right there
next to the air pump.

110
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,772
You know, for tires.

111
00:11:47,806 --> 00:11:49,941
Anyway, so that was my day.

112
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:52,343
How was yours?

113
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:56,197
- Dad?
- Yeah.

114
00:11:56,231 --> 00:12:00,118
Please,
can you just tell the truth?

115
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:06,407
Tell-- What do you mean?

116
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,693
You fainted, didn't you?

117
00:12:09,711 --> 00:12:11,712
'Cause you're sick again.

118
00:12:11,747 --> 00:12:14,332
You were pumping gas,
and the fumes,

119
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,634
they-- they made you
pass out again.

120
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,702
Just-- just admit it.

121
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,139
No, the-- no.

122
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,341
It was the pump.

123
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:29,764
All right, I-- I--

124
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,935
maybe I did get a little
swimmy at one point,

125
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:36,053
but I did not faint.
Okay?

126
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:38,606
I'm fine, and that's the truth.

127
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:40,891
However, in the best interest

128
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,944
of all of our continued
good health,

129
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:45,663
I don't think we can stay here.

130
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,498
I mean,
not until we get new carpet.

131
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,566
Yeah.

132
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,734
Uncle Hank and Aunt Marie,

133
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:54,071
they-- they got
plenty of space.

134
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:55,339
Hey, what about a hotel?

135
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:58,009
A hotel.
That could be sweet.

136
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,794
A-- a good one.

137
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,296
I like the way you're thinking.
Yes.

138
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:04,348
Could be a little
family vacation.

139
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,350
Might be fun.
What do you say?

140
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,802
Why don't you put
some clothes together?

141
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,189
Yeah. All right.

142
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,257
I'm sorry.

143
00:13:13,275 --> 00:13:16,894
It's not my finest hour.

144
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,362
I'll go pack a bag.

145
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,264
- Okay.
- Okay.

146
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,603
Think this'll leave a scar?

147
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:32,577
I never should have let
my Dojo membership run out.

148
00:13:38,383 --> 00:13:40,718
Jesus.
Jesse did that?

149
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,753
Yeah, but you gotta understand,

150
00:13:42,787 --> 00:13:44,555
deep down he loves me.

151
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,009
So... where is he?

152
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,645
- Still looking.
- Where have you looked?

153
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:53,231
His place, his folk's place,

154
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:55,566
uh, this Brock kid's place.

155
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,968
Crack shacks at Siesta Hills,

156
00:13:57,986 --> 00:14:00,438
the Indigo, the Crystal Palace,

157
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,356
go-kart joint
on Copper Ave.

158
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:05,142
Uh, AA meeting off the 40.

159
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,528
His buddies,
Beaver and what's-his-name?

160
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,197
Uh, Badger and Skinny Pete.

161
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,998
Yeah, no, he's not with them.

162
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,700
They could be covering for him.

163
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,452
I posed as a meter reader.

164
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,254
I put a bug in
the tall kid's mom's place.

165
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,655
For three hours straight,

166
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:20,091
all he talked about was
something called <i>Babylon 5.</i>

167
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,710
I checked with my gal at APD.

168
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,679
Uh, she said Pinkman's
not in their system,

169
00:14:24,713 --> 00:14:25,829
so the cops don't have him.

170
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:27,515
Yet.

171
00:14:27,549 --> 00:14:29,183
Maybe he changed his mind
about leaving,

172
00:14:29,218 --> 00:14:30,718
called your guy back.

173
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,337
No. Somebody misses their
first chance with my guy,

174
00:14:33,355 --> 00:14:35,356
there's no second.

175
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,725
Well, keep looking.

176
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,177
What then?

177
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,612
What do you mean?

178
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,648
I mean,
Pinkman's like a bad penny.

179
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,116
Sooner or later,
he's gonna turn up.

180
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,019
I'm wondering what
you wanna do when he does.

181
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,905
Jesse is upset about the boy.

182
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,157
I just need to explain to him

183
00:14:53,191 --> 00:14:54,792
why that had to happen.

184
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,630
Okay, but say, you know,

185
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,582
just for the sake of argument,

186
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,866
the kid's not in the mood

187
00:15:02,884 --> 00:15:04,919
for a nuanced discussion

188
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,870
of the virtues
of child poisoning.

189
00:15:06,888 --> 00:15:10,091
You know, his plans are running
more towards stabbing you to death

190
00:15:10,142 --> 00:15:11,175
with a pointed stick.

191
00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,178
In that scenario, then what?

192
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,732
You have a suggestion?

193
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:19,100
We were wondering

194
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:24,188
if maybe this isn't
an "Old Yeller" type situation.

195
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,657
"Old Yeller"?

196
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,409
Yeah, Old Yeller was the best,

197
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:30,411
most loyal dog there ever was.

198
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:32,330
I mean,
everybody loved that mutt,

199
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:35,166
but one day he showed up rabid,

200
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,069
and Little Timmy,
for Old Yeller's own sake,

201
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:42,072
had to, uh...

202
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,543
Oh, you--
you saw the movie.

203
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,879
You're full of colorful
metaphors, aren't you, Saul?

204
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:51,632
Belize, Old Yeller.

205
00:15:51,683 --> 00:15:53,751
Just brimming with advice.

206
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,810
Do not float that idea again.

207
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:07,782
Find him.

208
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:25,883
Sorry. Ah. Sorry. Room key wouldn't
let me into the ice room,

209
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,387
so I had to go down
to the front desk.

210
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,389
But here we are.

211
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:33,341
Checked in on Junior.

212
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:37,895
Pay-per-view and room service.
He's in heaven.

213
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:41,565
Hey, I thought you
were gonna take a bath.

214
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,819
How's Saul doing?

215
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:48,072
Saul? Goodman?

216
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:52,142
I have no idea.

217
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,695
No?

218
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:57,331
You were just out talking
to him in the parking lot.

219
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:04,255
I'm sorry.
Were you spying on me?

220
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,790
Yes.

221
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:08,843
And I feel
just awful about it too.

222
00:17:08,877 --> 00:17:10,961
You know, I played along

223
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:13,013
with your
pump malfunction bullshit

224
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:14,998
because Junior
was standing right there,

225
00:17:15,016 --> 00:17:18,386
but now I would like
to know what's going on.

226
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,478
First of all, it's no big deal.

227
00:17:27,512 --> 00:17:30,781
Coming here is just me
being overly cautious.

228
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:39,073
Jesse Pinkman, you know?

229
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:44,528
He came over to the house
that time for dinner, remember?

230
00:17:44,546 --> 00:17:47,715
Well, he-- he got upset

231
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:50,551
over this--

232
00:17:50,585 --> 00:17:53,971
something he thinks I did.

233
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,372
I did do it.

234
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:57,040
But I did it
for very good reasons.

235
00:17:57,058 --> 00:17:59,543
It's-- just--
it's complicated.

236
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:03,597
Wait. Are you--
are you telling me

237
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:05,566
that he tried to...

238
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,486
burn our house down?

239
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,356
That was,

240
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,576
probably for a brief moment,
his intention,

241
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,446
but obviously
he changed his mind.

242
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,916
And how does that work?

243
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,918
Him-- him changing his mind?

244
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:28,172
Ah, God.

245
00:18:28,206 --> 00:18:30,073
Look...

246
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,911
With-- You've got
to understand.

247
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:35,412
With-- with Jesse,

248
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:39,633
there are emotional issues,
personal issues,

249
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,385
some drug abuse.

250
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:47,358
But he has always been more of a
danger to himself than anyone else.

251
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:50,728
He has a tendency
to fly off the handle.

252
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:51,779
That's all.

253
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:54,865
So he has never hurt anybody?

254
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,496
No.

255
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,042
I can't believe
you got her down so fast.

256
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,448
Oh...

257
00:19:11,466 --> 00:19:14,718
So...

258
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,171
what's your course
of action here?

259
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:22,476
Saul's guy, Kuby,
tracks him down,

260
00:19:22,511 --> 00:19:24,595
which shouldn't take long,

261
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:28,349
and when he does, I'm gonna...

262
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,519
I'm gonna talk to him.

263
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,687
Make him see reason.

264
00:19:33,738 --> 00:19:36,323
"Talk to him.

265
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,026
Make him see reason."

266
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:45,699
So I'm clear,

267
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,369
these are just euphemisms...

268
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,321
you're using here, right?

269
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,342
No. What?

270
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:58,212
Wh-what does that mean?

271
00:19:58,263 --> 00:19:59,663
My God.

272
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,550
I knew
this was going to happen.

273
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,551
I knew it.

274
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:05,335
I told you that someday,

275
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:08,389
someone was going to come
to our door and try to hurt us.

276
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,890
And now here we are.

277
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,174
No.

278
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:13,811
Jesse didn't go there
to hurt anyone.

279
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,147
He poured gasoline
all over our house, Walt.

280
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:19,567
He tried to set
our house on fire.

281
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,019
He changed his mind.
He didn't do it, did he?

282
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:23,237
What if he changes it back?

283
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,827
Walt, you need

284
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,829
to deal with this.

285
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,414
How much have you had to drink?

286
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,383
Not nearly enough.

287
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,385
I-- I don't know
how we got off

288
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,806
on whatever it is
we're talking about here.

289
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:45,843
But clearly, I haven't explained
the situation well enough,

290
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,211
because this
is a big overreaction.

291
00:20:48,229 --> 00:20:52,066
We all need to just take
a deep breath and calm down,

292
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,069
because Jesse
isn't just some--

293
00:20:55,103 --> 00:20:58,022
some-- some rabid dog.

294
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,156
This is a person.

295
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,943
A person
that is a threat to us.

296
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,912
I mean, my God,

297
00:21:04,946 --> 00:21:08,666
where we are now
with Hank and Marie

298
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,035
and that awful tape we made.

299
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,570
After everything we've done,

300
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:16,573
you can't just talk
to this person.

301
00:21:16,591 --> 00:21:20,794
You're s-saying

302
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:24,348
that I just...

303
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:28,969
What-- what exactly
are you saying?

304
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:31,639
We've come this far.

305
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:35,258
For us.

306
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:40,447
What's one more?

307
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,180
Jesse!

308
00:22:33,214 --> 00:22:36,017
Stop what you're doing
and turn and face me!

309
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,238
You wanna-- you wanna
know what he did?

310
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:41,856
You wanna hear about it?

311
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:44,609
Jesse, put out the lighter.

312
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,578
He poisoned a little kid.

313
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,614
An eight-year-old boy.

314
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:51,782
Just because, you know--

315
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,567
just as a move!

316
00:22:53,585 --> 00:22:56,203
Walt's a bastard.
Secret's out.

317
00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:57,421
We'll talk about it.

318
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:01,125
But I need you to put out
the lighter, okay?

319
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:04,078
Look, Jesse...

320
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:06,080
Jesse,
I don't want to kill you.

321
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:08,633
And you don't wanna be killed.

322
00:23:08,684 --> 00:23:11,418
So put it out.

323
00:23:13,522 --> 00:23:17,391
He can't keep
getting away with it!

324
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:21,729
He can't keep
getting away with it!

325
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:23,030
He won't.

326
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,202
You really wanna burn him down?

327
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:31,956
Let's do it together.

328
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,763
So you were
fo-following me?

329
00:24:28,797 --> 00:24:31,382
Yeah.
Since Goodman's.

330
00:24:33,168 --> 00:24:35,302
Where we going now?

331
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:39,890
DEA. Downtown.

332
00:24:39,941 --> 00:24:43,510
What, I'm, like, arrested?

333
00:24:43,528 --> 00:24:45,863
Yeah, you know how this works.

334
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,365
Be a good witness for me,

335
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:50,484
it'll go better for you.

336
00:24:50,518 --> 00:24:53,520
Yeah, sitting around MDC,

337
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:56,207
waiting to be a witness
against Mr. White.

338
00:24:56,241 --> 00:24:58,576
It's...

339
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,795
It's gonna go great for me.

340
00:25:10,088 --> 00:25:14,875
So... you're angry.

341
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:18,729
I can't sleep.
I'm not eating.

342
00:25:20,482 --> 00:25:25,052
Last night I was online for six hours
looking up untraceable poisons.

343
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,054
This close family friend

344
00:25:27,072 --> 00:25:29,407
had been keeping a secret
from you and Hank,

345
00:25:29,441 --> 00:25:33,611
and somehow this person's
secret became known,

346
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,830
and now you're sad and hurt

347
00:25:35,864 --> 00:25:38,082
and angry.

348
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,620
I'm--
I'm in the ballpark?

349
00:25:44,572 --> 00:25:47,541
To be this wrong about someone.

350
00:25:47,575 --> 00:25:49,627
This off.

351
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:52,913
We all live double-lives
to some extent, don't we?

352
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:54,748
- We all have our secrets.
- Yeah.

353
00:25:54,766 --> 00:25:56,767
Not like this.

354
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,054
Not like him.

355
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:04,108
Marie, I think it's time
you filled me in

356
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,093
on some more details here.

357
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:08,279
Who and what
are we talking about?

358
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,231
I said I can't do that.

359
00:26:10,265 --> 00:26:12,817
It'd be bad for Hank.

360
00:26:12,868 --> 00:26:16,287
Our friend made that clear
in his little movie.

361
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:21,659
Those kids...

362
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:24,912
under his roof.

363
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,280
That baby.

364
00:26:26,314 --> 00:26:30,751
I'm sick
just thinking about it.

365
00:26:30,785 --> 00:26:33,420
How could I have not seen this?

366
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,126
If I weren't being such a...

367
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:42,496
idiotic, stupid idiot,
I could've--

368
00:26:42,531 --> 00:26:44,532
We could have...

369
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:50,671
Blackjack winnings.

370
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:53,774
Nothing suspicious
about that at all.

371
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:56,310
Tell me about this movie.

372
00:26:56,328 --> 00:26:59,697
Dave, can't we simply

373
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:01,815
just focus on my feelings here?

374
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,418
The details don't
really matter, do they?

375
00:27:04,452 --> 00:27:06,754
There is nothing
to be done, okay?

376
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:08,706
He screwed us, and he won.

377
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,709
Can we just...

378
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,378
Can we talk about
something else, please?

379
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:16,347
Yes?

380
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:20,000
How's work?

381
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:24,355
Last week, you were upset
about the new parking rules.

382
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,529
Marie?

383
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:35,699
Saxitotoxin.

384
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:37,701
"Derived from shellfish.

385
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:42,356
Produces a flaccid paralysis
that leaves the victim conscious

386
00:27:42,374 --> 00:27:45,960
through a progression
of symptoms.

387
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:48,078
Death occurs
from respiratory failure."

388
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:50,697
That is definitely a contender.

389
00:27:50,715 --> 00:27:53,367
Marie,

390
00:27:53,385 --> 00:27:56,470
you're not ready
to fill me in here,

391
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,839
that's fine.

392
00:27:58,873 --> 00:28:01,875
But I want you to listen.

393
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:05,312
There is no problem,
no matter how difficult

394
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:08,715
or painful
or seemingly unsolvable,

395
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,517
that violence won't make worse.

396
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:14,405
I know. I...

397
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,574
Don't worry.
I wouldn't hurt anybody.

398
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:19,243
I just...

399
00:28:22,414 --> 00:28:26,917
It just feels good
to think about it.

400
00:28:34,092 --> 00:28:36,677
- Hey, babe.
- What's the story here?

401
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,929
Oh, uh, well, uh,
something's come up.

402
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:41,265
I thought you might wanna
get outta the house for a day or two.

403
00:28:41,299 --> 00:28:44,351
You thought I might wanna
pack up and move out of my own house.

404
00:28:44,386 --> 00:28:45,936
Why?
What's going on?

405
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,355
Look, I don't wanna
get into it now.

406
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,774
But you know that thing with Walt?
There's, uh--

407
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:52,776
there's been a development.

408
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:54,612
What happened?
Are you in danger?

409
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,280
No. No, no, no,
not at all.

410
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,399
Just--
it's a fluid situation,

411
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,985
and I think it might go a little
smoother if you're not here.

412
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:03,437
So, I, uh--
it'll be great, you know?

413
00:29:03,455 --> 00:29:05,772
I-I-I booked you
a spa package at La Posada.

414
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,708
You can do
that river stones thing.

415
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:09,994
Hank, what the hell
is going on?

416
00:29:12,414 --> 00:29:14,381
Hank?

417
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:16,667
We have a guest.

418
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,145
He was a little keyed-up.
Gave him a couple sleeping pills.

419
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,472
Okay. So listen.

420
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:40,858
I bring that kid in and--
and put him in the system,

421
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,476
Walt's gonna find out
five minutes later.

422
00:29:42,494 --> 00:29:45,979
You know, my last ten witnesses
died in jail, remember?

423
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:48,999
A-a-and I can't use a DEA safe
house without writing him up.

424
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,784
I can't risk a-- a motel.

425
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:53,671
I know it sounds crazy,
but this is the best place for him.

426
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,956
For now.
Just for a day or two, tops.

427
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,492
Okay, just answer me
this one question...

428
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,494
Is this bad for Walt?

429
00:30:00,512 --> 00:30:02,046
Yeah. Very.

430
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:06,016
Good. I'm staying.

431
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:08,502
I'll heat up lasagna.

432
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,971
Phone's ringing.

433
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:26,987
<i>You have one new voice mail.</i>

434
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:31,691
<i>Jesse, listen.</i>

435
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,460
<i>Uh...</i>

436
00:30:33,495 --> 00:30:36,246
<i>I mean, obviously</i>
<i>you've changed your mind here,</i>

437
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:39,083
<i>and so thank you for that.</i>

438
00:30:39,134 --> 00:30:41,218
<i>And I know you're angry.</i>

439
00:30:41,252 --> 00:30:44,588
<i>And I wanna fix this, okay?</i>

440
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:47,174
<i>Whatever it takes, all right?</i>

441
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,259
<i>We'll talk,</i>
<i>and we will fix this.</i>

442
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:54,231
<i>Until then, just--</i>

443
00:30:54,265 --> 00:30:57,234
<i>just... sleep it off, okay?</i>

444
00:30:57,268 --> 00:30:59,903
<i>And then call me.</i>

445
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,888
<i>Be safe.</i>

446
00:31:27,893 --> 00:31:29,944
Hey.

447
00:31:29,978 --> 00:31:31,445
Hey.

448
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,364
What are you still doing up?

449
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:35,032
Couldn't sleep.

450
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,984
Ah. You and me both.

451
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:39,687
Here. Have a seat.

452
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:47,912
- Everything okay?
- Oh, yeah.

453
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:51,299
Just business stuff.

454
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:54,719
Going over some options.

455
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:58,172
You guys still think
you might buy another car wash?

456
00:32:01,393 --> 00:32:04,312
Oh, uh, yeah.
Well, maybe.

457
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:06,547
See how it goes.

458
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:08,549
How it goes now that--

459
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:11,435
now that you're--
you're sick again, right?

460
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:15,072
No. That's not
what I mean.

461
00:32:15,107 --> 00:32:18,192
Hey. Told you not to worry,
remember?

462
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:20,278
H-how can I not worry?

463
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,946
Come on.

464
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:23,781
You think I came all this way

465
00:32:23,832 --> 00:32:26,000
just to let something
as silly as lung cancer

466
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:28,836
take me down?

467
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,789
Not a chance.

468
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,542
I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,933
Should've brought
our suits, huh?

470
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,028
It's okay.

471
00:32:55,096 --> 00:32:56,930
It's all right.

472
00:33:05,273 --> 00:33:07,124
I'll be up in a minute.

473
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:08,993
Okay.

474
00:33:09,044 --> 00:33:10,944
See you in the morning.

475
00:33:10,962 --> 00:33:12,913
Okay.

476
00:34:13,174 --> 00:34:15,759
Would you like some coffee?

477
00:34:34,713 --> 00:34:36,630
Morning.

478
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,549
You want some coffee?

479
00:34:38,583 --> 00:34:40,918
Uh, no.
Uh, the lady, um--

480
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,920
I think your wife--

481
00:34:42,971 --> 00:34:44,922
You take cream and sugar?

482
00:34:44,973 --> 00:34:47,925
Uh, black's--
black's good.

483
00:34:48,176 --> 00:34:50,094
Thanks.

484
00:34:59,437 --> 00:35:01,939
Uh, thanks.

485
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:07,778
Thanks.

486
00:35:17,038 --> 00:35:19,239
This is probably
gonna take awhile.

487
00:35:19,273 --> 00:35:21,158
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

488
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:23,127
- I'll run some errands.
- Okay.

489
00:35:23,161 --> 00:35:24,795
<i>All right.</i>

490
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:27,614
Uh, you remember, uh,
Agent Gomez?

491
00:35:31,336 --> 00:35:33,303
How you feeling?
Your head clear?

492
00:35:33,338 --> 00:35:35,756
Yeah.

493
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,758
This-- this can't be
what you mean

494
00:35:37,792 --> 00:35:41,461
by burning him
to the ground, right?

495
00:35:41,479 --> 00:35:43,847
I-I got stories
that'll make your toes curl,

496
00:35:43,898 --> 00:35:47,818
but, you know, it's just
"My word against his word" kind of stuff.

497
00:35:47,852 --> 00:35:51,188
So, you know, I don't really have
any, like, proof or anything.

498
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,190
Gomie, can you, uh, grab
the curtains over there?

499
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,909
There's a--
there's a glare thing happening here.

500
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,198
You know he's retired,
right? He's--

501
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:03,333
he's not even
in the business anymore.

502
00:36:03,368 --> 00:36:05,502
So you're never gonna catch him
with a camcorder.

503
00:36:05,537 --> 00:36:06,987
We're gonna catch him.

504
00:36:07,005 --> 00:36:09,123
We gotta do this first, okay?
Come on.

505
00:36:16,131 --> 00:36:18,899
Just, uh, tell us
everything you remember.

506
00:36:18,933 --> 00:36:22,386
Any business dealings,
any personal dealings,

507
00:36:22,437 --> 00:36:25,773
any criminal activity you
were a witness or a party to.

508
00:36:25,807 --> 00:36:27,691
Anything and everything.

509
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,227
Just tell us your story, okay?

510
00:36:31,279 --> 00:36:33,346
Start from the beginning.

511
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:35,849
When did you
first meet Walter White?

512
00:36:37,952 --> 00:36:40,404
Right. Okay, uh...

513
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:46,577
I first met Mr. White--

514
00:36:46,628 --> 00:36:48,879
Walter White--

515
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:52,082
in junior year chemistry.

516
00:36:54,669 --> 00:36:57,037
He was my teacher.

517
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,904
You believe him?

518
00:37:13,938 --> 00:37:16,690
Yeah.
I do, unfortunately.

519
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:18,692
And I hate to admit it,

520
00:37:18,726 --> 00:37:21,278
but I think the kid is right.

521
00:37:21,329 --> 00:37:23,730
There is no physical evidence,
not that I heard.

522
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:25,899
Yeah, well, no weapons,

523
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,502
no bodies, no working lab.

524
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,371
Just the word of one nut-job
meth-head

525
00:37:31,405 --> 00:37:34,041
against
Mr. Rogers-Has-A-Lung-Tumor.

526
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:36,260
So, do we take a run
at Lydia Rodarte-Quayle?

527
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:39,596
Vamonos Pest? Follow up
with the Drew Sharp killing?

528
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,098
Where do we start?

529
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:44,084
I say we start with this.

530
00:37:44,102 --> 00:37:46,419
<i>Jesse,</i>

531
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:50,891
<i>I'm gonna be at Civic Plaza</i>
<i>tomorrow at noon.</i>

532
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:52,893
<i>I hope you'll</i>
<i>give me the chance</i>

533
00:37:52,927 --> 00:37:55,262
<i>to explain myself</i>

534
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,615
<i>and talk through everything</i>
<i>once and for all.</i>

535
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:04,104
<i>I'll be alone and unarmed.</i>

536
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,824
<i>So if you wanna come</i>
<i>and shoot me in the head,</i>

537
00:38:06,875 --> 00:38:09,209
<i>that's up to you.</i>

538
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:13,463
<i>Either way,</i>

539
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,999
<i>I'm in your hands.</i>

540
00:38:26,811 --> 00:38:29,129
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

541
00:38:29,147 --> 00:38:31,131
Go and talk to that asshole?

542
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,133
You-- you can't
be serious.

543
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:34,634
Go and listen.

544
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:36,353
He wants to explain himself.

545
00:38:36,404 --> 00:38:38,972
We put a wire on you
and let him explain.

546
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,142
So your plan is to do his plan?

547
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,161
You-- you seriously think
that this--

548
00:38:44,195 --> 00:38:47,281
this whole "Once and for all
in the Plaza" thing

549
00:38:47,315 --> 00:38:48,782
is so he can talk to me?

550
00:38:48,816 --> 00:38:51,335
Why not?

551
00:38:51,369 --> 00:38:54,487
I-- I--
I can't believe you two.

552
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:58,091
The dude wanted me out of town before
I came to burn his house down,

553
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,294
and now I'm even more
of a threat to him, okay?

554
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:03,213
And he's got a zero-tolerance
policy on threats, you know?

555
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:06,550
If I go to this Plaza,
I'm a dead man is why not.

556
00:39:06,601 --> 00:39:08,719
Hey, Walt's ruthless.

557
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,939
He'll do just about anything
to protect his interests.

558
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:15,726
I agree.
Except when it comes to you.

559
00:39:15,777 --> 00:39:18,729
He cares about you.

560
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,564
Can't you see?

561
00:39:20,615 --> 00:39:22,866
Oh, yeah.
You mean when he's not,

562
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:25,702
uh, ripping me off
or calling me an idiot

563
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:28,789
or poisoning people
that I care about?

564
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:31,742
Yeah, no, Mr. White's gay for me.
Everyone knows that.

565
00:39:31,793 --> 00:39:34,995
No, I mean it.
Based on everything you told us.

566
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:37,047
Uh, he paid for your rehab,

567
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:39,299
uh, ran over those two
drug dealers with his car.

568
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,084
Sounds like he saved your life.

569
00:39:41,135 --> 00:39:43,503
Uh, made you a 50-50 partner.
He didn't need to do that.

570
00:39:43,537 --> 00:39:46,773
Yeah, no, he sort of did. I'm the
only one near as good as him, so...

571
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:48,442
I don't know.
The way you tell it,

572
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,811
sounds to me like he's
manipulating you to stick around.

573
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:52,312
Like he doesn't wanna lose you.

574
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:54,231
All those numbers
he-- he runs on you,

575
00:39:54,265 --> 00:39:56,900
over and over,
helping you find the ricin cigarette.

576
00:39:56,935 --> 00:39:58,902
Come on.
Look how far he'll go to show you--

577
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,772
to convince you
that he's not such a bad guy.

578
00:40:01,823 --> 00:40:04,391
- That's what this is.
- What if it's about, um,

579
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,393
killing me, you know?

580
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:08,745
You know, getting me
out in the open,

581
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,332
hire some, uh--
some clock tower guy,

582
00:40:12,367 --> 00:40:15,902
or-- or have me sit on a poison needle,
or something, you know?

583
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,404
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

584
00:40:17,422 --> 00:40:19,406
I mean, the Plaza's
one of the most wide-open

585
00:40:19,424 --> 00:40:21,241
public places
in all of Albuquerque.

586
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:22,742
It's middle of the day.

587
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,928
And Agent Gomez and I
will be right there with you.

588
00:40:24,963 --> 00:40:27,080
Look--
look, you two guys

589
00:40:27,098 --> 00:40:31,134
are just... guys, okay?

590
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:34,921
Mr. White--
he's the devil.

591
00:40:34,939 --> 00:40:37,641
You know, he is--
he is smarter than you,

592
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:39,693
he is luckier than you.

593
00:40:39,727 --> 00:40:41,945
Whatever-- whatever you think
is supposed to happen--

594
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:45,098
I'm telling you,
the exact reverse opposite

595
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:47,100
of that is gonna happen, okay?

596
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:51,038
Jesse-- Jesse,
we're not brainstorming here.

597
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:53,323
This is not asking.

598
00:40:53,374 --> 00:40:55,492
Unless you know
another way to get the man,

599
00:40:55,543 --> 00:40:57,160
or unless
you wanna take your chances

600
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:59,212
with the banger boys
over in MDC,

601
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,881
then this is it.

602
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:03,450
This is what's happening.

603
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,452
I gotta piss.
Can I piss?

604
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:08,121
Yeah.
Down to the left.

605
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,292
You got another SD card?

606
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:16,430
What?

607
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:19,316
What if the kid's right?
What if it's a trap?

608
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,685
"The kid"?

609
00:41:21,736 --> 00:41:24,237
Oh, you mean
the junkie murderer

610
00:41:24,272 --> 00:41:26,473
that's dribbling all over
my guest bathroom floor?

611
00:41:28,192 --> 00:41:30,360
Well, then, he's right.

612
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:32,812
Pinkman gets killed,

613
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,332
and we get it all on tape.

614
00:41:41,736 --> 00:41:44,004
Remember, you're
hurt, you're angry,

615
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,006
but you're here
for answers, okay?

616
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,676
But don't, uh--
don't push the questions, okay?

617
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:51,178
Let's not get him suspicious,
all right?

618
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:54,265
You let him do the talking,
right?

619
00:41:54,316 --> 00:41:56,400
Just relax. That's what--
that's what matters most.

620
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,435
Don't cross your arms,
if you can help it.

621
00:42:01,323 --> 00:42:02,856
Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.

622
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:04,942
<i>Pancho Villa, Salma Hayek.</i>
<i>You getting that?</i>

623
00:42:04,993 --> 00:42:06,694
Loud and clear, <i>idiota.</i>

624
00:42:06,728 --> 00:42:08,228
<i>How's it looking, Gomie?</i>

625
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,915
No change.

626
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:12,866
<i>He's just sitting there.</i>

627
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,835
<i>Are we doing this, or what?</i>

628
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,870
Ready to kick some ass, partner?

629
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:23,294
All right.
Time to go.

630
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,292
Hey, Hank, you got eyes on this?
What's with the kid?

631
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:47,327
He's just standing there.

632
00:43:47,345 --> 00:43:50,163
<i>What the hell's he doing?</i>

633
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:14,371
He's on the move now.

634
00:44:14,406 --> 00:44:15,989
He's taking off.
I think he's running.

635
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:18,191
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, kid.
Come on.

636
00:44:26,885 --> 00:44:30,003
You got him?
He's at the pay phone.

637
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:32,172
Who the hell is he calling?

638
00:44:34,426 --> 00:44:36,677
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Come on, kid.

639
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:38,645
No! Come on!

640
00:44:51,276 --> 00:44:52,609
Hello?

641
00:44:53,661 --> 00:44:55,729
Nice try, asshole.

642
00:44:56,748 --> 00:44:58,665
<i>Jesse, where are you?</i>

643
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,367
<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>

644
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:03,737
No. I'm not doing what you want anymore.
Okay, asshole?

645
00:45:03,755 --> 00:45:07,040
<i>This is just a heads-up to let
you know I'm coming for you.</i>

646
00:45:08,042 --> 00:45:09,593
<i>See, I decided</i>

647
00:45:09,627 --> 00:45:11,745
<i>that burning down your house</i>
<i>is nothing.</i>

648
00:45:11,763 --> 00:45:15,349
Next time, I'm gonna get you
where you really live.

649
00:45:15,383 --> 00:45:17,634
<i>Jesse, listen to me.</i>

650
00:45:17,685 --> 00:45:20,771
Jesse? Jesse?

651
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:47,498
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Hey!

652
00:46:00,478 --> 00:46:02,846
Get in.

653
00:46:02,897 --> 00:46:04,798
Little son of a bitch!

654
00:46:04,816 --> 00:46:06,466
Stupid, high little--

655
00:46:06,484 --> 00:46:08,134
What the hell
was that all about, huh?

656
00:46:08,153 --> 00:46:09,653
What were you thinking?

657
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:11,688
- Thinking there's another way.
- What?

658
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,492
To get him.
There's another way.

659
00:46:17,662 --> 00:46:19,613
A better way.

660
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:39,049
Uh...

661
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,767
Hey.

662
00:46:40,802 --> 00:46:42,636
It's Walt.

663
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:49,193
I'm okay.

664
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:51,311
I, uh...

665
00:46:53,031 --> 00:46:54,781
Todd,

666
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:58,285
I think I might have
another job for your uncle.

667

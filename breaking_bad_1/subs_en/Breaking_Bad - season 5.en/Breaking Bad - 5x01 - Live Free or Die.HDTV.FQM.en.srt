1
00:00:00,074 --> 00:00:02,564
Last season on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:04,393
I will kill your wife,

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,791
I will kill your
infant daughter.

4
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,581
- Skyler White sent you?
- Just checking writing times.

5
00:00:10,387 --> 00:00:11,715
Brock... how is he doing?

6
00:00:11,885 --> 00:00:13,425
He just keeps getting worse.

7
00:00:13,543 --> 00:00:15,299
He's not safe.
He was poisoned.

8
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:18,894
It wasn't the ricine.
It was the lily of the valley.

9
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:22,652
What about Mike?

10
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:24,779
With this injury?
No travel.

11
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:29,950
We've got work to do.

12
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:33,832
Here you go.

13
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:04,995
What happened there?

14
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:09,265
It's my birthday.

15
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,300
Yeah? Well,
Happy Birthday.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,937
Birthday meals are
free at Denny's.

17
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:16,505
All you gotta show
is a valid ID.

18
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,441
I'm good. Thanks.

19
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:22,278
Really? Free meal.
Free is good.

20
00:01:22,312 --> 00:01:25,146
Even if I was, like, rich,
free is always good.

21
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:29,284
Okay.

22
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:39,693
New Hampshire. You're
a long way from home.

23
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:40,927
How long a drive is that?

24
00:01:40,928 --> 00:01:44,507
About 30 hours
before you stop for gas.

25
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,600
Wow. You headed
to California?

26
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:49,836
No. Here.

27
00:01:52,607 --> 00:01:54,708
So what's here?

28
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:02,482
Business.

29
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,050
You know, I was in Boston once,

30
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:06,452
Boston and a little town
called Swampscott,

31
00:02:06,487 --> 00:02:08,488
which is right
outside of Boston.

32
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:10,256
That's kind of near
New Hampshire, right?

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,225
Uh...

34
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:15,560
Yeah. More or less.

35
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,997
Yeah, I was maybe 6,
so I don't really remember it.

36
00:02:19,032 --> 00:02:21,833
I want to say I liked it.
They got this really big aquarium.

37
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,436
Yeah.
Great science museum there.

38
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,173
Excuse me.

39
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,311
Hi. My name's Lucy.
I'll be your server.

40
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:56,599
I get to worry this one would
end up crossing the border?

41
00:02:58,635 --> 00:03:00,902
It's never leaving town.

42
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:05,874
Is there a-- a manual?
Instruction manual?

43
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:07,742
I pulled something
off the internet.

44
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:09,445
It's in there.

45
00:03:12,648 --> 00:03:14,550
Good luck, I guess.

46
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,019
Happy Birthday,
Mr. Lambert.

48
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:10,765
Jesus, Walt, the news here--

49
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,433
Gus Fring is dead.

50
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:16,674
He was blown up along with some
person from some Mexican cartel,

51
00:05:16,786 --> 00:05:19,826
and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.

52
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:22,410
Do you know about this?

53
00:05:24,312 --> 00:05:25,579
Walt?

54
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:31,652
Walt, I need you to--

55
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,088
<i>We're safe.</i>

56
00:05:50,504 --> 00:05:52,104
Was this you?

57
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,276
<i>What happened?</i>

58
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,613
I won.

59
00:07:15,383 --> 00:07:16,783
Oh, God.

60
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:47,445
Dad.

61
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,815
- Dad.
- Hey.

62
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:53,250
Hey.

63
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:56,287
You don't have the TV on?
Seriously?

64
00:07:56,322 --> 00:07:59,290
Uh, no, sorry, I--
No...

65
00:07:59,325 --> 00:08:01,726
You didn't tell him
about Mr. Fring?

66
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,827
Um, he knows.

67
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:04,828
I--

68
00:08:04,862 --> 00:08:05,829
Welcome home.

69
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:07,831
Jesus, dad, it--

70
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:10,334
It's all they're talking about.

71
00:08:10,368 --> 00:08:13,036
They-- they haven't
said it on TV yet,

72
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,473
but Uncle Hank says he was this,
major, major drug dealer.

73
00:08:16,507 --> 00:08:19,642
I mean, like, holy shit.

74
00:08:19,676 --> 00:08:23,312
Your uncle is safe, right?
How do they know that?

75
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:25,981
Uncle Hank was
after this guy all along.

76
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:28,217
He didn't tell us, but he was.

77
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,820
He even took me
to his restaurant one time,

78
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:34,189
just, like, totally toying
with the guy,

79
00:08:34,224 --> 00:08:37,092
just like "I got my eye
on you," like that.

80
00:08:37,126 --> 00:08:40,062
They figure
Mr. Fring is the one

81
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,064
who put the hit out
on Uncle Hank.

82
00:08:42,098 --> 00:08:44,366
Just somebody got to him first.

83
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,367
Wow.

84
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,202
Yeah, wow.

85
00:08:47,237 --> 00:08:51,939
Aunt Marie's
still pretty freaked.

86
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:54,876
But mom figured it was time.

87
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,477
Huh.

88
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:58,712
There's still some agents
over there,

89
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:02,049
but they figure it's over.

90
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,818
Like, when this hits the news,

91
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:07,088
Uncle Hank
is going to be a hero.

92
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:08,155
Yeah.

93
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,223
I mean, even more so
than before.

94
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,526
Seriously.

95
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,728
See-- See if it's on TV.

96
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,229
Yeah, yeah, I want to.

97
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:28,974
Just-- just give me
a couple minutes, huh?

98
00:09:31,211 --> 00:09:33,446
Hi.

99
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,814
Hi.

100
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:41,453
Hi, sweet pea.

101
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,855
Oh, daddy missed you so much.

102
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,026
Yes, he did.

103
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,797
I know.
I missed you, too.

104
00:09:57,536 --> 00:10:00,571
Well, don't you think
I rate a "hello," at least?

105
00:10:04,009 --> 00:10:05,176
Hello.

106
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,612
Hello.

107
00:10:11,383 --> 00:10:12,716
Hello to you, too.

108
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:19,489
So are you gonna talk
to me here?

109
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:21,891
Are you gonna--

110
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:24,761
You gonna show some kind of--

111
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:28,798
I don't know--
Some kind of mild relief

112
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:30,399
that I'm alive?

113
00:10:32,336 --> 00:10:34,070
I am relieved, Walt.

114
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,506
And scared.

115
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,709
Scared?

116
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,279
Scared of what?

117
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:48,249
You.

118
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,292
Hey.

119
00:11:01,229 --> 00:11:02,629
Hi.

120
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:30,056
Oh, shit.

121
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,534
Jesus, just say it already.

122
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:55,335
Tell me "I told you so."

123
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:56,570
Get it out of your system

124
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:59,339
before you need, like,
dialysis or something.

125
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,875
It's exactly like
Boetticher's drawings.

126
00:13:03,912 --> 00:13:09,149
Where were the two bodies?

127
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,186
No idea who they were?

128
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,888
Nah, not much left.

129
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:19,158
Apparently the teeth do this popcorn
thing when they get too hot,

130
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,927
so they tell me.

131
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,496
Whoever torched it,
did it up right.

132
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:31,703
Fring, you magnificent bastard.

133
00:13:42,314 --> 00:13:45,617
Huh. What do you
figure that was?

134
00:13:45,651 --> 00:13:56,093
I don't know. Some kind
of lab equipment?

135
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:57,662
Maybe a camera?

136
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:17,012
Come on. Be nice.
Just be nice.

137
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:21,050
You be nice. Just be nice.

138
00:14:21,084 --> 00:14:22,418
Let Wendell in there.

139
00:14:23,587 --> 00:14:26,656
If Wendell doesn't eat,
nobody eats.

140
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,123
Yeah.

141
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,325
Are you sure?
Are you completely sure?

142
00:14:30,359 --> 00:14:35,397
And what about...?
Yes, I will tell him. Yes, I will tell him.

143
00:14:39,935 --> 00:14:41,703
It's Gustavo.

144
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:44,939
He's dead.

145
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:22,441
Son of a bitch.

146
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:26,010
Son of a bitch.

147
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:27,578
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hold up! Hold up!

148
00:15:27,613 --> 00:15:29,013
Get out of my way, kid.

149
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:30,448
Mike, wait a minute,
all right? Let him talk.

150
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:31,883
"Let him talk." I am done

151
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:33,918
listening to this asshole talk.

152
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,620
Now get out of my way.

153
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:37,922
He's got something
you need to hear, all right?

154
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:39,557
What did you do, Jesse?

155
00:15:39,591 --> 00:15:40,891
Do you even know?

156
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:44,427
Do you even know
what you've done?

157
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:45,695
One more word--

158
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,497
Mike. Mike.

159
00:15:47,531 --> 00:15:49,466
If you kill him, you're
going to have to kill me.

160
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,135
Come on.

161
00:15:53,104 --> 00:15:55,838
Oh, Jesse.

162
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,573
Jesus.

163
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,210
What is it with you guys?

164
00:16:01,245 --> 00:16:03,146
Honest to God.

165
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,415
May I?

166
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:12,587
Look. Whatever differences
you and I have, they'll keep.

167
00:16:12,621 --> 00:16:15,090
Right now we've got
bigger fish to fry.

168
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,826
Bigger fish.

169
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,427
The video cameras.

170
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:22,330
Gus kept cameras on us
at the lab,

171
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:24,800
at the laundry,
God only knows where else.

172
00:16:24,834 --> 00:16:26,234
And, of course,
when I say "us,"

173
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:27,568
including you.

174
00:16:27,603 --> 00:16:28,903
Mike.

175
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:32,506
Mike, if he taped
all that shit--

176
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:35,276
Us cooking, you picking up...

177
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,913
If Gus had a record of that and the
police get to it before we do...

178
00:16:38,947 --> 00:16:41,816
- You son of a bitch.
- Mike, it's all on tape somewhere,

179
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:44,483
or a hard drive.

180
00:16:44,518 --> 00:16:45,985
Where?

181
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,420
Where did he keep it?

182
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:55,895
He had a laptop in his office.
He kept it at the back of the restaurant.

183
00:16:57,264 --> 00:16:59,365
It all fed straight to there.

184
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,041
What?

185
00:17:09,075 --> 00:17:10,976
Keys, scumbag.

186
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,112
It's the universal symbol
for keys.

187
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,229
<i>Meter fraud.</i>

188
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:47,699
Yes, yes, it's a big deal.

189
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,702
Guy rigs his meter
so he's paying two cents less

190
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,570
for first-class postage.

191
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,304
I'm here to tell you

192
00:17:54,338 --> 00:17:57,240
that the USPS
takes that very seriously.

193
00:17:57,274 --> 00:18:01,311
It's money out of your pocket.
It's money out of my pocket.

194
00:18:01,345 --> 00:18:04,915
I was hoping--
Now, look, sarge.

195
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:07,017
Do you think we could work
together on this thing?

196
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,652
You folks have it over there?

197
00:18:08,686 --> 00:18:10,519
Could you tell me that,
at least?

198
00:18:13,957 --> 00:18:15,057
Yeah.

199
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:17,326
Yeah.

200
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:20,963
Well, thanks for your help.

201
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:23,465
Uh, Inspector Clark,
Inspector Dave Clark,

202
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,267
like the Dave Clark Five?

203
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:28,503
Oh, before your time.

204
00:18:28,537 --> 00:18:31,906
Well, you feel free to call me
day or night at this number.

205
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:36,911
Yes, sir.
No, you as well.

206
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:40,815
Oh, yeah.

207
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,817
We're boned.

208
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:48,588
Well...

209
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:52,259
You know how they say

210
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:54,061
"it's been a pleasure"?

211
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,664
It hasn't.

212
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:00,099
Are you going to tell us
about the laptop?

213
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:04,037
- Where you going?
- I'm gettin' the hell out of dodge, kid,

214
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,337
and so should you.

215
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,106
It's just a matter of time.

216
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,708
Mike,

217
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:10,609
where is the laptop?

218
00:19:10,644 --> 00:19:11,944
What the hell difference
does it make?

219
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:13,712
They got it. End of story.

220
00:19:20,687 --> 00:19:24,489
APD, Northwest area command,
on 2nd.

221
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,524
They tagged it, they filed it,

222
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,093
it's in the system,

223
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,427
and they locked it
in their evidence room.

224
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:33,463
All right.

225
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:37,668
All right. So...
Describe the building.

226
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:40,071
Describe the--

227
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:42,106
How about I describe Fort Knox?

228
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,741
And what are you going to do?

229
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:47,777
Are you going to put on your black leotard
and go dangling on a close line?

230
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,479
It's a building full of cops.
What else do you need to know?

231
00:19:50,514 --> 00:19:53,583
And why in the hell
am I talking to you?

232
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:56,252
Mike, we gotta do something.

233
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,723
I am doing something.

234
00:19:59,757 --> 00:20:02,124
He's good with this stuff.
Just give him a chance.

235
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:04,292
Now, you look.

236
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:07,495
That laptop might as well
be on the Moon.

237
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:09,164
They build these evidence rooms

238
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,900
like bank vaults
because guess what.

239
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,970
Lunatics like you
want to break into them.

240
00:20:15,004 --> 00:20:20,815
But unlike a bank vault this is a place
that is guarded 24 hours a day

241
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:22,676
by the police.

242
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:25,113
There's no way you're
getting it out of there.

243
00:20:25,147 --> 00:20:32,153
Who said that we have to
get it out of there?

244
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,788
We just need to destroy
what's on it.

245
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:37,590
Oh, so now you want
to blow up a police station.

246
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,525
I don't believe
I said that, no.

247
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,462
Nursing home full of old folks
just whet your appetite.

248
00:20:42,496 --> 00:20:43,830
Now you want to kill
a bunch of cops.

249
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:46,332
I've never said anything
about killing anybody.

250
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:49,469
I am, however, considering
the possibility of a device.

251
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:51,771
- A device.
- Yes, a small device.

252
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:54,974
Say this device
gets filed into evidence.

253
00:20:55,008 --> 00:20:56,575
Now, it is inside that room.

254
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:57,977
What about a magnet?

255
00:20:58,011 --> 00:20:59,245
You want to commit
a whole other crime

256
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,180
just to get this bomb
of yours into evidence.

257
00:21:01,214 --> 00:21:03,282
Who said bomb?
I said a device.

258
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:05,550
- Yo, what about, like, a magnet?
- An incendiary device.

259
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:07,385
One quick fire
is all it would take.

260
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:09,053
You don't think they have
fire suppression?

261
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,255
I'm not talking
about sprinklers.

262
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,590
I'm talking about halon, because
halon doesn't destroy evidence.

263
00:21:13,624 --> 00:21:15,259
- A magnet, though, maybe like--
- All right, so a bomb, then.

264
00:21:15,293 --> 00:21:17,627
Maybe we plant a bomb outside.

265
00:21:17,662 --> 00:21:19,963
Oh, actually I knew
a crew out of Fort Worth

266
00:21:19,998 --> 00:21:22,432
that tried to blow up an
evidence room from outside.

267
00:21:22,466 --> 00:21:24,902
About all they did was
take out a couple of hedges.

268
00:21:24,936 --> 00:21:27,304
You are probably talking
about 2 feet

269
00:21:27,338 --> 00:21:29,005
of reinforced concrete.

270
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,639
Or what about a magnet?

271
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:33,009
What magnet?
What about it?

272
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,845
You know, just a...

273
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:53,829
So what do you think?

274
00:21:53,863 --> 00:21:54,996
Expensive.

275
00:21:55,031 --> 00:21:57,332
Leaving aside engineering,

276
00:21:57,366 --> 00:22:00,302
rigging some kind of
alternate power source,

277
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:04,338
my primary sticking point
is I actually need the thing,

278
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:05,906
as you gentlemen can see,

279
00:22:05,941 --> 00:22:07,374
it's paying the bills.

280
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:10,945
But I mean it's
feasible, doable?

281
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:12,379
Hey, we're living in a time

282
00:22:12,413 --> 00:22:15,216
of, uh, string theories
and God particles.

283
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,351
Feasible, doable?
Yeah, sure, why not?

284
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:19,719
Expensive.

285
00:22:21,455 --> 00:22:28,161
What would you put it in?

286
00:22:28,195 --> 00:22:31,064
What about that?
Does it run?

287
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:33,298
We can get it running.

288
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,767
What's the box made of?

289
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:37,769
Plywood and aluminum--
just what you need.

290
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:42,374
All right,
so you want to talk money?

291
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:45,878
Step into my office.

292
00:22:50,349 --> 00:22:52,316
Hey, listen. Um...

293
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,053
I don't actually have
any money right now.

294
00:22:57,455 --> 00:23:01,425
My wife-- There's
an IRS issue anyway.

295
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,694
I'd appreciate it if you
could spot me my share.

296
00:23:03,728 --> 00:23:07,430
- I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, whatever.

297
00:23:07,464 --> 00:23:08,765
Right.

298
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:12,802
You coming?

299
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,205
If you have any brains,

300
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,773
you'll take that money you save

301
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:19,009
and you'll skip town--

302
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:20,877
Today. Right now.

303
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:23,946
You don't think this can work?

304
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,515
Is that a serious question?

305
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:28,650
Mike,
this is a three-man job.

306
00:23:28,684 --> 00:23:30,485
The only way I know
it won't work for sure

307
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:32,087
is if we don't have you.

308
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:07,354
Come in.

309
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:11,123
Oh. Get in.

310
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,092
Close the door.

311
00:24:13,126 --> 00:24:15,895
What did we
say about you coming here?

312
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,965
Yeah, speaking of things
that tend to rile you up,

313
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,768
uh, the police--They may call.

314
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,436
Let me--
let me back up a little.

315
00:24:23,471 --> 00:24:25,871
Can I s-- can I sit down?
I'm going to sit down.

316
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:28,907
Okay, w-w-why are
the police going to call?

317
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:31,844
May call you. Distant,
outside possibility.

318
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:35,046
But on the off chance I want you
thinking one thought--

319
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,782
<i>Hogan's Heroes.</i>

320
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:38,951
Sergeant Schultz.
Do you remember Sergeant Schultz?

321
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:41,052
"I know nothing.
I see nothing."

322
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:43,754
Do you remember how he--
I want you like that.

323
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,358
- Okay, Saul, why are the police--
- There was a incident, with Beneke...

324
00:24:47,392 --> 00:24:49,059
Oh, God.

325
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:51,863
- And it's--
- Oh, Jesus. What incident?

326
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:53,397
An act of God.

327
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:54,999
There's no right.
There's no wrong.

328
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:58,034
I mean, it just--
that's the best phrase.

329
00:24:58,068 --> 00:25:02,038
It fits, but we got a problem.

330
00:25:06,477 --> 00:25:07,911
Ted's dead.

331
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:10,680
Sorry?

332
00:25:10,715 --> 00:25:12,949
Ted is dead?

333
00:25:12,984 --> 00:25:15,651
No. No, no.

334
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,053
He just woke up.

335
00:25:24,014 --> 00:25:26,750
Right-o, that should do 'er.

336
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:28,818
All right, watches off

337
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:32,723
necklaces, earrings,
rings, bracelets...

338
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,324
Gold.
These are non-ferrous.

339
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:35,659
Better hope.

340
00:25:35,693 --> 00:25:37,293
What about that stuff
you young guys wear

341
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:38,494
on the end or your pricks?

342
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:41,597
Speak now
or forever sing soprano.

343
00:25:41,598 --> 00:25:43,332
What's up with that,
by the way?

344
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,134
Why would anybody
wanna put a metal ring

345
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,502
through the end of the prick?

346
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:50,038
What are you looking at me for?

347
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:54,342
All right, uh, guns, knives,

348
00:25:54,377 --> 00:25:57,412
tools, keys, plates
in your head,

349
00:25:57,446 --> 00:25:59,414
artificial hips.

350
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,793
Check your pockets one
more time, please.

351
00:26:02,885 --> 00:26:05,153
Oh, uh, credit cards.

352
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:08,955
You want that plastic working,
come Miller Time.

353
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,294
You know, I can foresee a lot of
possible outcomes to this thing,

354
00:26:13,328 --> 00:26:16,463
and not a single one of them
involves Miller Time.

355
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:18,499
P.M.A.

356
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,634
Positive mental attitude.

357
00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:23,003
Uh, okay, I think
we're good to go.

358
00:26:24,105 --> 00:26:26,539
All right, where do you
want me with this?

359
00:26:26,573 --> 00:26:27,840
Start 40 feet out.

360
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:29,509
That's more than
the length of the room.

361
00:26:29,543 --> 00:26:31,277
- Who's doing the honors?
- Me.

362
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:33,279
Flip that switch, turns it on.

363
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:35,515
Twist this here.
That's your power control.

364
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:37,149
- All right.
- Everybody ready?

365
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,984
- Yeah.
- Okay.

366
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:40,952
Fire in the hole!

367
00:26:44,457 --> 00:26:46,090
All right, you ready?

368
00:26:59,538 --> 00:27:02,239
Fingers crossed it don't
yank the drive shaft

369
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,407
through the floor.

370
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:19,722
Anything?

371
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:25,160
No. Still working.

372
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:28,797
All right, start walking.

373
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,075
Whoa. Whoa-whoa.

374
00:27:41,109 --> 00:27:42,677
Wait-wait-wait-wait.

375
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:44,211
Yeah. That did it.

376
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:49,350
Yes.

377
00:27:49,385 --> 00:27:50,817
Whoa.

378
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:57,491
Yeah, bitch!

379
00:27:57,525 --> 00:27:59,893
Magnets! Oh!

380
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,531
How many batteries is this?

381
00:28:04,565 --> 00:28:07,165
That there's 21,
wired in series,

382
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,203
so 21 times 12, 252 volts.

383
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:13,873
Can you add 21 more,
wired in parallel?

384
00:28:13,907 --> 00:28:16,041
Up the amperage?

385
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:24,849
Everything goes flying
in that evidence room,

386
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:27,118
it's gonna make
one hell of a noise,

387
00:28:27,152 --> 00:28:29,020
and there goes your
element of surprise.

388
00:28:30,022 --> 00:28:31,756
Won't matter.

389
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,825
Sixty seconds, we'll be gone.

390
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,584
Hi. Who are you looking for?

391
00:29:01,618 --> 00:29:04,219
Um, Ted Beneke.
I'm a friend of his.

392
00:29:04,254 --> 00:29:06,322
But if it's not a good time,
I could--

393
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:08,157
No, no, no, this is fine.
I'm just finishing up.

394
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:09,391
Come on in.

395
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,038
Hey, Ted.

396
00:29:27,008 --> 00:29:28,642
I tell you,
he's been a real champ.

397
00:29:28,677 --> 00:29:31,211
His color's better,
and his blood pressure's up.

398
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:32,446
We are going to have you

399
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:34,348
eating solid food
in a day or two.

400
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:35,950
I bet you money.

401
00:29:36,952 --> 00:29:38,385
That's wonderful.

402
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,089
All right,
I'm just down the hall.

403
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,467
Ted.

404
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,563
Can you hear me?

405
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,141
Yes.

406
00:30:06,913 --> 00:30:08,446
Ted, I just--

407
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:15,953
Skyler...

408
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:18,589
I haven't said anything...

409
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,326
to anyone.

410
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:28,198
I told them it was an accident.

411
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:33,803
I tripped and fell.

412
00:30:33,838 --> 00:30:35,271
That is all they know.

413
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:39,676
I just--

414
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:45,248
I've-- I've got children.

415
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,551
Family.

416
00:30:50,453 --> 00:30:51,887
I swear to you.

417
00:30:54,257 --> 00:30:55,724
Please.

418
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,094
I just--

419
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:05,366
I...

420
00:31:06,835 --> 00:31:10,137
will never breathe...

421
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:15,176
one word of this.

422
00:31:24,686 --> 00:31:25,919
Good.

423
00:32:46,328 --> 00:32:50,098
It should be about a quarter
of the way down on the left.

424
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,900
We'll do a loop and come
around the other side.

425
00:32:51,934 --> 00:32:53,101
Turn here.

426
00:33:05,547 --> 00:33:07,447
Right up there.

427
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:09,616
That's the wall.

428
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,017
Oh, what the hell is this?

429
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:13,186
There's some big-ass hump
in the way.

430
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,889
So just drive over it.

431
00:33:15,923 --> 00:33:17,891
- All right.
- You can do it.

432
00:33:17,925 --> 00:33:20,326
Take it easy. Take it easy.

433
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,729
You got it.

434
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,204
Cut it.

435
00:33:33,206 --> 00:33:34,506
It's, like, 8 feet away.

436
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,474
Is this cool?
Is this close enough?

437
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:38,143
It'll work.

438
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:00,554
Mr. White, let's go.

439
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:02,657
Hang on.

440
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:04,457
- Let's just go!
- Hang on.

441
00:35:04,492 --> 00:35:07,194
Mr. White,
let's get out of here.

442
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:08,528
Just...

443
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:11,331
one minute.

444
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,039
Whoops.
Turn it off!

445
00:35:20,073 --> 00:35:21,274
Turn it off.

446
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,514
Jacocks, you okay?

447
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:31,050
Outside! Outside!

448
00:35:50,469 --> 00:35:51,936
Oh!

449
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:53,938
Yes! Bitch!

450
00:35:53,972 --> 00:35:56,040
- Shut up.
- Oh. Yeah.

451
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:57,975
What exactly
are you celebrating?

452
00:35:58,009 --> 00:35:59,210
You left the truck behind.

453
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:00,444
So what?

454
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:01,912
So what?

455
00:36:01,947 --> 00:36:03,547
So what if they find prints?

456
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:06,851
And what if they trace it
back to the wrecking yard?

457
00:36:06,885 --> 00:36:08,751
They won't.

458
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:10,720
There's no prints.
I made sure of that.

459
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,788
There's no paperwork
on the truck,

460
00:36:12,823 --> 00:36:14,557
the magnet, or the batteries.

461
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:17,460
Untraceable salvage, all of it.

462
00:36:17,494 --> 00:36:19,562
I made sure of that, too.

463
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,164
Well, you got all the answers,

464
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:22,866
so you tell me, answer man,

465
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,900
did all that
even work just now?

466
00:36:24,934 --> 00:36:27,837
Yes. It worked.

467
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:30,573
I'm supposed to
take that on faith?

468
00:36:30,607 --> 00:36:32,375
Yeah?

469
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:33,676
Why?

470
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,846
How do we know?

471
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,347
Because I say so.

472
00:37:06,772 --> 00:37:10,141
07-66-26432.

473
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:11,909
Gutierrez, Alvin B.

474
00:37:11,944 --> 00:37:13,276
Roofing hammer.

475
00:37:14,345 --> 00:37:16,579
Undamaged. Bag still sealed.

476
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:25,889
11-58-73321.

477
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:27,490
Fring, Gustavo.

478
00:37:27,525 --> 00:37:29,458
Samsung laptop computer.

479
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:32,828
Damaged. Glass screen
is broken and in pieces.

480
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,396
Bag still sealed.

481
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:46,508
11-58-73317.

482
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:47,976
Fring, Gustavo.

483
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,545
Framed photograph of two men.

484
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:50,812
Damaged.

485
00:37:50,846 --> 00:37:53,081
The glass is broken,

486
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,284
and photo has slipped
out of its frame.

487
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:58,820
Bag appears to be slightly
punctured by broken glass.

488
00:37:59,989 --> 00:38:02,523
Hm. Check it out.

489
00:38:04,726 --> 00:38:06,093
That's not on the manifest.

490
00:38:07,796 --> 00:38:09,330
All right, so first off,

491
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:11,031
I'm not a marriage counselor.

492
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,633
Nor do I takes sides
in this thing.

493
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:17,171
And, not taking sides, mind you, but
you did put her in charge of your money,

494
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:20,207
which I advised against,
if you'll recall,

495
00:38:20,241 --> 00:38:23,243
all of which is not to be
construed as an "I told you so".

496
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:25,913
I'm just walking you
through my mental process,

497
00:38:25,947 --> 00:38:27,848
so to speak.

498
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:33,486
So she comes to me
with a problem.

499
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:35,154
She's been cooking
Beneke's books,

500
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,723
he's in Dutch with the IRS,

501
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,057
and once they audit,

502
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:40,093
it's "Rio de caca"
for the both of them,

503
00:38:40,127 --> 00:38:44,597
to which I say "hey, let's involve
Walt in this discussion,"

504
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:47,700
to which she says, "no,
let's cut Beneke a check

505
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:49,702
so's he can pay off the IRS."

506
00:38:49,736 --> 00:38:51,636
Again, not taking sides,

507
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,905
but she really was
trying to protect you.

508
00:38:57,143 --> 00:38:59,477
A little feedback here
might be nice.

509
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,716
"Let's involve Walt
in this discussion."

510
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:06,416
Yeah, that's what I told her.

511
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:07,852
She said no.

512
00:39:07,886 --> 00:39:10,187
And you didn't argue the point.

513
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,256
You didn't think to contact me.

514
00:39:14,525 --> 00:39:16,093
You were a tad preoccupied

515
00:39:16,128 --> 00:39:18,528
at the time, if you'll recall.

516
00:39:18,563 --> 00:39:23,266
Okay. So you took it
upon yourself

517
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,171
to give away $622,000
of my money

518
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:31,707
to a man who had been
sleeping with my wife.

519
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:35,879
She's my client, same as you.

520
00:39:35,913 --> 00:39:38,847
Does this arrangement get
a little tricky at times?

521
00:39:38,882 --> 00:39:43,351
Absolutely. But I try my best,
you know, ethically, my duty...

522
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:48,456
Ethically? I'm sorry, I must be
hearing things.

523
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:53,428
Did you actually just use the
word "ethically" in a sentence?

524
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:55,930
You're not Clarence Darrow,
Saul.

525
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:58,532
You're a two-bit
bus-bench lawyer,

526
00:39:58,566 --> 00:40:00,201
and you work for me.

527
00:40:00,235 --> 00:40:02,603
Yeah, well, Clarence didn't ever
have a client like you

528
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:04,605
ask him for something...

529
00:40:06,275 --> 00:40:07,374
like this.

530
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,777
Okay? Yeah, I put my ass
on the line for you.

531
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:12,445
Huell, too. Huh?

532
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,080
He's got fingers like hotdogs.

533
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:15,849
He could've easily busted
this in two

534
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:19,186
and killed everyone in the
office, but do I complain?

535
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,022
No. Beg, borrow, or steal,
I'm your huckleberry.

536
00:40:22,056 --> 00:40:24,925
I go the extra mile.

537
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:29,295
Only you never told me that the kid
would wind up in the hospital.

538
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:31,396
You know--

539
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:33,899
Take that thing and get
the hell out of here.

540
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:35,367
You and me, we're done.

541
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,785
Come on. Hey.

542
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,120
Hey.

543
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,689
H--

544
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,126
We're done

545
00:41:03,161 --> 00:41:05,462
when I say we're done.

546
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,578
I heard what happened to Ted.

547
00:42:00,249 --> 00:42:02,183
He's not going to talk.

548
00:42:02,218 --> 00:42:03,717
Yeah.

549
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:30,843
I forgive you.

550
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,500

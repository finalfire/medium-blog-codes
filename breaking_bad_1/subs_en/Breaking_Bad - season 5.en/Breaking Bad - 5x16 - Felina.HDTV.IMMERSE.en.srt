00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,353
On my son's 18th birthday,

168
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:42,638
which is ten months

169
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:44,923
and two days from today,

170
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:47,092
you will give him this money

171
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,278
in the form
of an irrevocable trust.

172
00:11:49,312 --> 00:11:51,446
You will tell him
that it is his

173
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:54,432
to do with as he sees fit,

174
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,151
but with the hope

175
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:59,538
that he uses it for
his college education.

176
00:11:59,572 --> 00:12:01,373
And for the betterment
of his family.

177
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,609
Walt, I'm not sure
that we follow.

178
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:07,462
Why, uh, I mean,

179
00:12:07,497 --> 00:12:09,331
why, in particular,
would we--

180
00:12:09,382 --> 00:12:11,133
If you wanna give
your kids drug money,

181
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,501
go do it yourself.

182
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,219
I can't.

183
00:12:14,253 --> 00:12:16,672
My wife and son hate me.

184
00:12:16,723 --> 00:12:19,391
They won't take my money.

185
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,093
Even if they did,

186
00:12:21,127 --> 00:12:23,478
the federal government
wouldn't let them.

187
00:12:25,565 --> 00:12:27,649
But two rich benefactors,

188
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:30,319
who are known for their
charitable endeavors,

189
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:32,137
who would think nothing
of, for instance,

190
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:34,439
writing a $28 million check

191
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:38,360
to help victims of
methamphetamine abuse?

192
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:40,779
I have to think that your money

193
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:41,997
would be very welcome.

194
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:44,315
It wouldn't make
any sense coming from us.

195
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:45,984
It certainly would.

196
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:48,153
My children are
blameless victims

197
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:50,839
of their monstrous father.

198
00:12:50,873 --> 00:12:53,375
A man who you
once knew quite well.

199
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:00,832
Call it a beau geste,

200
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,184
call it liberal guilt,

201
00:13:02,218 --> 00:13:03,552
call it whatever you want,

202
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,504
but do it.

203
00:13:05,538 --> 00:13:08,640
And you are not to spend

204
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:12,277
a single dime
of your own money.

205
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:13,879
If there are taxes

206
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:16,548
or lawyers' fees owed,

207
00:13:16,582 --> 00:13:18,316
you will take it
right from here.

208
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:21,236
They use my money, never yours.

209
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,854
Okay, Walt, sure.

210
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:25,123
That--
that sounds reasonable.

211
00:13:27,377 --> 00:13:30,245
So what happens next?

212
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:32,581
I guess we shake on it,

213
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,633
and I leave.

214
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:06,748
I can trust you to do this.

215
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:08,250
Yes.

216
00:14:08,284 --> 00:14:11,286
Absolutely you can.

217
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:26,968
Oh!

218
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:28,637
Don't move.
Don't...

219
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:30,105
Don't dare move a muscle.

220
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,273
You don't want them to think

221
00:14:31,307 --> 00:14:33,058
that you're trying to get away.

222
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:34,476
Just breathe.

223
00:14:37,063 --> 00:14:38,263
Just this afternoon,

224
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:40,398
I had an extra $200,000

225
00:14:40,432 --> 00:14:41,783
that I would have loved dearly

226
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:45,153
to leave on top of this table.

227
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:46,955
Instead,

228
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:48,824
I gave it to the two best

229
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,244
hitmen west of the Mississippi.

230
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:54,612
Now,

231
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:59,835
whatever happens
to me tomorrow,

232
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:01,970
they'll still be out there.

233
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,791
Keeping tabs.

234
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:08,176
And if,

235
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,345
for any reason,

236
00:15:10,396 --> 00:15:14,465
that my children
do not get this money,

237
00:15:14,484 --> 00:15:16,685
a kind of...

238
00:15:16,736 --> 00:15:18,970
countdown will begin.

239
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:21,306
Maybe a day or so later,

240
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,774
maybe a week, a year,

241
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,826
when you're going for
a walk in Santa Fe

242
00:15:24,861 --> 00:15:27,812
or Manhattan
or Prague, wherever,

243
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,831
and you're...

244
00:15:29,866 --> 00:15:32,868
talking about
your stock prices...

245
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:39,424
without a worry in the world.

246
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,043
And then suddenly,

247
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:43,929
you'll hear the scrape

248
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,380
of a footstep behind you,

249
00:15:45,431 --> 00:15:47,465
but before you can
even turn around,

250
00:15:47,499 --> 00:15:49,500
- pop!
- Aah!

251
00:15:54,357 --> 00:15:56,358
Darkness.

252
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:05,033
Cheer up, beautiful people.

253
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,071
This is where
you get to make it right.

254
00:16:23,336 --> 00:16:26,338
[Gretchen sobs]

255
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:00,238
Oh, yeah, right.

256
00:17:08,347 --> 00:17:09,514
You know, I don't exactly

257
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,683
know how to feel
about all this.

258
00:17:11,717 --> 00:17:13,184
For real, yo.

259
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,854
Whole thing felt kinda shady,
you know, like,

260
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:17,055
morality-wise?

261
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,090
Totally.

262
00:17:20,592 --> 00:17:24,429
How do you feel now?

263
00:17:24,447 --> 00:17:25,596
Better.

264
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:28,433
Yeah, definitely improving.

265
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:29,985
[Walt] What's this I hear about

266
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:33,622
blue meth still
being out there?

267
00:17:33,656 --> 00:17:34,623
What do you mean?

268
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:36,458
Have you heard anything?

269
00:17:36,492 --> 00:17:38,493
Is it still being sold?

270
00:17:40,997 --> 00:17:42,998
Yeah.

271
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:49,387
By whom?

272
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,557
It's you, right?

273
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:54,509
I mean, aren't you
still cooking?

274
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,230
Damn, man.

275
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:00,932
We were sure it was you,

276
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,600
because that shit
is choice, yo.

277
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:03,985
Better than ever.

278
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,354
I mean, um, you know.

279
00:18:08,658 --> 00:18:09,858
Jesse.

280
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:10,975
Seriously?

281
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:12,694
You said he moved to Alaska.

282
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:14,812
That's what I heard.

283
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:15,947
Right on, Jesse.

284
00:18:15,981 --> 00:18:17,982
Passing the torch.

285
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,230
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

286
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:10,452
[Blows]

287
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,508
Wow, what happened there?

288
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,126
It's my birthday.

289
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:10,595
Yeah? Well,
happy birthday.

290

[Hank] <i>It's easy money.</i>

00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:01,646
<i>Until we catch you.</i>

292
00:21:01,681 --> 00:21:02,764
Walt, just say the word

293
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:04,466
and I'll take you
on a ride-along.

294
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,651
You can watch us knock down
a meth lab, huh?

295
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,571
Get a little excitement
in your life.

296
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,940
Someday.

297
00:21:38,935 --> 00:21:40,001
Welcome to The Grove.

298
00:21:40,019 --> 00:21:41,103
Would you like to see a menu?

299
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:42,187
No, thank you.

300
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,022
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

301
00:21:44,056 --> 00:21:45,840
All right, you got it.

302
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,458
Hey, how you doing?

303
00:22:03,493 --> 00:22:05,377
Good.

304
00:22:05,411 --> 00:22:07,662
How's things?

305
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:09,697
Hey, I like your...

306
00:22:12,084 --> 00:22:13,368
shirt.

307
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:14,386
My blouse?

308
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:16,371
Nice, yeah, the color.

309
00:22:16,389 --> 00:22:19,558
That's a nice color on you.

310
00:22:19,592 --> 00:22:20,926
It's kind of a--

311
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,511
I don't know exactly
what you'd call it.

312
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:26,231
It's kind of a cornflower.

313
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:27,566
Before you say or do anything,

314
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,435
just hear me out.

315
00:22:30,486 --> 00:22:31,553
Todd--

316
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:32,887
Nobody knows that I'm here.

317
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:34,856
Just listen for two minutes

318
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,408
and then I'll leave.

319
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,776
Please.

320
00:22:37,827 --> 00:22:39,161
Please.

321
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:40,562
Just two minutes of your time.

322
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,582
That's all I ask.

323
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,867
Please.

324
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:54,676
You're running out
of methylamine, aren't you?

325
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,212
I can do the math.

326
00:22:57,246 --> 00:22:58,547
You've been at it long enough.

327
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:01,516
You must be running low.

328
00:23:01,551 --> 00:23:04,719
I have a new method

329
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:06,638
that requires no methylamine.

330
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:07,889
And it's easy, and it will

331
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:09,090
keep you in business.

332
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:11,593
And Todd, I could
teach it to you.

333
00:23:11,611 --> 00:23:14,779
How did you know
to find us here?

334
00:23:14,814 --> 00:23:17,782
10:00 AM
every Tuesday morning,

335
00:23:17,817 --> 00:23:19,734

Sorry.

00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:48,763
I need the money.

341
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:51,683
I've spent almost all of mine.

00:23:56,689 --> 00:23:59,658
Mr. White, I don't
think there's--

345
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:04,329
How much would it cost us?

346
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,114
Nothing short of a million,

347
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,666
and believe me, for this,

348

is giving it away.

I can come up there tonight

354
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,164

and that I gave you
that ticket.

Those numbers
are GPS coordinates.

484

That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

487

That's where
I buried our money.

The men who stole it from us,

489

the men who still have it,

490
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:51,983
they murdered Hank and Steve

491
00:32:52,018 --> 00:32:54,519
and put them in that hole.

492
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,740

00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,947
so... thought I'd stop by.

335
00:24:08,965 --> 00:24:12,117
Well, I, uh,
wish you'd called first.

336
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,720
This isn't the best time.

337
00:24:14,754 --> 00:24:17,255
Well, Flynn looks like
he can hold down the fort.

338
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,290
Why don't we go
into your office?

339
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,516
I-- I got it.

340
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:30,519
Okay, honey.
Thanks.

341
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:46,484
Marie, I have nothing to say.

342
00:24:46,502 --> 00:24:47,669
Well, I do.

343
00:24:47,704 --> 00:24:50,923
So you can just
sit there and listen.

344
00:24:52,208 --> 00:24:54,793
I got a call from Hank.

345
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,328
He arrested Walt
three hours ago.

346
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,714
It's over.

347
00:24:58,765 --> 00:25:01,883
"Dead to rights"
I believe is the expression.

348
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,802
Hank and Steve Gomez

349
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:06,188
are working with
a former associate of Walt's,

350
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:09,224
Jesse Pinkman,
whom I know you know,

351
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:10,859
and Pinkman has supplied them

352
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:14,196
with everything they need.

353
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:18,066
Hank is booking Walt
as we speak.

354
00:25:18,117 --> 00:25:20,569
And I, for one,
could not be happier.

355
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:29,327
I almost didn't come here.

356
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:32,631
Christ, I barely
even know who you are,

357
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,765
and I sure as hell don't know

358
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,001
if I can ever trust you again.

359
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,211
And then I think about
how you are so upset with Walt

360
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,081
and how you wanted
the kids out of the house,

361
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,483
and all of this
makes me believe

362
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:53,952
that there has got
to be hope for you,

363
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:57,255
that whatever
he did to you can be undone.

364
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:06,431
All I know-- all I have been
forcing myself to remember,

365
00:26:06,466 --> 00:26:08,166
is that you are my sister.

366
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:12,304
And so I'm here.

367
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,309
Marie.

368
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,343
Everything changes now.

369
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:21,680
And you have got
to prepare yourself.

370
00:26:21,714 --> 00:26:24,415
Hank will help you
as much as he can.

371
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:25,434
I know he will.

372
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:29,971
And... I will support you
through this.

373
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:33,442
But I have conditions.

374
00:26:33,476 --> 00:26:34,476
I want you to give me

375
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:35,894
every single copy
of that obscenity

376
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,596
that the two of you made
to discredit Hank.

377
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:43,101
That DVD.
Every single copy.

378
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:45,737
You understand me?

379
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,572
Answer me.
Do you understand me?

380
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:50,542
Yes.

381
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:54,446
Good.

382
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,082
Now dry your eyes
and get Flynn in here,

383
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,885
because you are going to tell him everything,
and I mean everything, Skyler.

384
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,155
He deserves to know
the truth from his family.

385
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:04,656
Not a bunch
of uniformed strangers.

386
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:07,476
No. No.
No, he cannot-- No.

387
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,129
You tell him. Or I will.

388
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:13,265
There's no way around this.

389
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,935
He needs to know,
and he needs to know now.

390

No.
[Groaning]

393
00:28:09,372 --> 00:28:12,624
Look, I gave you
what you wanted.

394
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,993
Come on.
Man, please.

395
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,461
Hey, please.

396
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,047
I told you where
to find the tape, okay?

397
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:21,416
Hey, just-- just-- just go.

398
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:22,751
Just-- just go there.

399
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,219
Just go to his house
and get it.

400
00:28:24,253 --> 00:28:25,253
We're on it.

401
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:27,756
Get it!

402
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:29,925
No one else knows about it.

403
00:28:29,976 --> 00:28:31,760
Just me and his partner.

404
00:28:31,811 --> 00:28:32,811
[Todd] Okay.

405
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:35,013
No one else knows!
I swear!

406

[Grunts]

00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,828
Let's cook.

409
00:30:39,284 --> 00:30:43,854
You're completely
out of your mind.

410
00:30:43,888 --> 00:30:45,422
It's the truth.

411
00:30:45,457 --> 00:30:46,507
It is, Flynn.

412
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:48,959
Then both of you
are out of your minds.

413
00:30:48,993 --> 00:30:50,661
You're full of shit,
is what you are.

414
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:51,679
Both of you.

415
00:30:51,713 --> 00:30:53,631
If-- if this is true,

416
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:55,883
then how could you
keep this a secret?

417
00:30:55,934 --> 00:31:01,555
I mean, why?
Why would you go along?

418
00:31:01,606 --> 00:31:03,140
I'll be asking myself that

419
00:31:03,174 --> 00:31:04,858
for the rest of my life.

420
00:31:04,893 --> 00:31:07,394
So you're saying
all of this time

421
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,029
you were lying about this?

422
00:31:09,064 --> 00:31:11,014
I mean, so you're saying...

423
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:12,316
you're a liar.

424
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,451
You-- you just admitted it.

425
00:31:14,486 --> 00:31:18,288
So were you lying then,
or are you lying now?

426
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,040
Which lie is it?

427
00:31:20,075 --> 00:31:22,793
Flynn, honey, your mother
is telling you the truth.

428
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:25,412
Right here, right now.
Believe it.

429
00:31:25,463 --> 00:31:26,863
You know what?

430
00:31:26,881 --> 00:31:28,865
This-- this is bullshit.

431
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,501
This is bullshit.

432
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,969
I wanna talk to dad.

433
00:31:32,003 --> 00:31:33,537
Your dad's in custody.

434
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,639
You won't be able to talk to him
for a while, sweetie.

435
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:36,757
I'm calling Uncle Hank.

436
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:38,142
I've tried.
He's not answering.

437
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:40,978
Probably because he is in the
thick of it with your father.

438
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:44,014
Honey, I know this is a lot
to process, Flynn,

439
00:31:44,048 --> 00:31:45,099
but if you could just breathe.

440
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,934
Just try to breathe,
and just trust--

441
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,820
Really? Really?
Try to breathe?

442
00:31:52,724 --> 00:31:53,724
Oh, my God.

443
00:31:53,725 --> 00:31:56,577
[Door closes]

444
00:31:58,462 --> 00:31:59,595
Go home.

445
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,047
Just take the kids home, okay?
Go home and regroup.

446
00:32:03,082 --> 00:32:04,403
I'll stop by later.

00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:43,807
Could you put
your seatbelt on please?

Please.
It's not safe.

You're shittin' me, right?

454
00:32:56,988 --> 00:33:00,991
If all this is true
and you knew about it,

455
00:33:01,025 --> 00:33:04,127
then-- then you're
as bad as him.

Listen.

I need you to come inside
and pack right now.

that you were arrested?

No, just--

00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:37,027
They say that you're
some kind of drug dealer?

463

No, just come inside,
please. Now.

Come inside. Come on.

right now is to pack.

they said he arrested you?

all of this later, okay?

It means...

we're fine, okay?

<i>Walt, you have to stop.</i>

665
00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:18,729
<i>You have to stop this.</i>
<i>It's immoral. It's illegal.</i>

666
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,614
<i>Someone might get hurt."</i>

667
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:23,701
<i>You're always whining</i>
<i>and complaining</i>

668
00:42:23,735 --> 00:42:25,169
<i>about how I make my money,</i>

669
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:26,954
<i>just dragging me down.</i>

670
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:31,041
<i>While I do everything.</i>

671
00:42:31,075 --> 00:42:32,843
<i>And now--</i>

672
00:42:32,877 --> 00:42:37,181
now you tell my son what I do

673
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:40,584
<i>after I've told you</i>
<i>and told you</i>

674
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:44,104
<i>to keep your damn mouth shut.</i>

675
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:49,943
You stupid bitch.

676
00:42:49,978 --> 00:42:52,479
<i>How dare you?</i>

677
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:06,410
I'm sorry.

678
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:14,301
You, you have no right

679
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:18,422
to discuss anything
about what I do.

680
00:43:18,456 --> 00:43:20,758
Oh, what-- what the hell
do you know about it anyway?

681
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:23,310
<i>Nothing. I built this.</i>

682
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:25,479
<i>Me. Me alone.</i>
<i>Nobody else!</i>

683
00:43:25,513 --> 00:43:28,965
You're right.

684
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,934
You're right.

685
00:43:30,969 --> 00:43:36,640
You mark my words, Skyler.

686
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,609
Tow the line,

687
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:42,579
or you will wind up
just like Hank.

688
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,001
Walt.

689
00:43:48,036 --> 00:43:51,588
Tell me what happened.

690
00:43:51,623 --> 00:43:54,258
Where is Hank?

691
00:43:54,292 --> 00:43:56,460
Please.

692
00:43:56,494 --> 00:43:58,045
We need to know.

693
00:44:03,968 --> 00:44:06,770
You're never gonna
see Hank again.

694
00:44:12,176 --> 00:44:16,280
<i>He crossed me.</i>

695
00:44:16,314 --> 00:44:19,700
<i>You think about that.</i>

696
00:44:19,734 --> 00:44:23,787
<i>Family or no.</i>

697
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:26,287
You let that sink in.

698
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:31,361
<i>Walt.</i>

699
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:36,700
<i>I just want Holly back.</i>

700
00:44:36,718 --> 00:44:39,480
<i>Please, Walt.</i>

701
00:44:42,206 --> 00:44:44,892
<i>Just come home.</i>

702
00:44:51,566 --> 00:44:55,102
I've still got things
left to do.

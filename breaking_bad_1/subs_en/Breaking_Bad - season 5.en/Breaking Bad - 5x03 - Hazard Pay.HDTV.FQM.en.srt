00:00:00,005 --> 00:00:02,878
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:04,949
So, first order of business is

3
00:00:05,077 --> 00:00:06,566
to find a new place to cook.

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,970
Partnership.
Three ways.

5
00:00:08,127 --> 00:00:09,357
No, thanks.

6
00:00:09,454 --> 00:00:10,371
These men were on payroll.

7
00:00:10,512 --> 00:00:11,464
My guys are solid.

8
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,288
They're paid to stand
up to the heat.

9
00:00:13,405 --> 00:00:14,438
I am scared.

10
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:15,721
- Of what?
- You.

11
00:00:15,846 --> 00:00:18,308
Fring had all these
secret off shore accounts.

12
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:19,598
He's not impressed, Gomie.

13
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,043
Perhaps he's picturing all
that money going bye-bye.

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,088
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,588
Maybe, why?

16
00:00:26,684 --> 00:00:28,468
I reconsidered, I'm in.

17
00:00:28,614 --> 00:00:29,627
Good.

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,074
Subtitles downloaded from www.OpenSubtitles.org

19
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,593
- Hey, Darla. How you doing today?
- Hey, Dan.

20
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:43,594
I'm looking for something
in a Markowski.

21
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,831
That'd be, uh,
Dennis Markowski?

22
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:48,799
That's the one.

23
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,972
Oh, and I've got my, uh,
paralegal with me today.

24
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,441
Paralegal?
Coming up in the world.

25
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:58,990
You know it.

26
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,762
Hey, Dennis.

27
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:21,797
Have a seat.

28
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,489
<i>You hear about Chow?</i>

29
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:51,725
Yeah, people say
he skipped town.

30
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,561
He's dead.

31
00:01:54,564 --> 00:01:56,564
It wasn't me.

32
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,666
It wasn't a message.
It wasn't payback.

33
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,068
It was a mistake
made by a third party

34
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,703
who has since been dealt with.

35
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,036
You got it?

36
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,705
- Yeah.
- The second thing...

37
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:09,309
The deal you had with Fring--
it's still in place.

38
00:02:09,343 --> 00:02:10,476
Okay.

39
00:02:10,511 --> 00:02:12,478
Don't "okay" me.

40
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:14,547
You got something to say?

41
00:02:16,217 --> 00:02:19,185
Mike, I'm keeping
my mouth shut.

42
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,320
The laundry
was right above the lab.

43
00:02:21,354 --> 00:02:23,088
There's no way I could say
I wasn't in on it.

44
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:26,325
I'm looking
at eight years minimum.

45
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,527
But I'm doing my time
like I'm supposed to.

46
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:31,396
I'm no rat, and you know it.

47
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:33,398
What else is there to say?

48
00:02:33,433 --> 00:02:35,233
All due respect,
what are we talking about here?

49
00:02:35,267 --> 00:02:37,602
The deal is the deal.

50
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,807
How's the deal the deal?

51
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,809
The feds took away
my hazard pay.

52
00:02:45,844 --> 00:02:48,646
My wife comes to me and asks me
where the mortgage is coming from.

53
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,047
I got nothing to tell her.

54
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:53,650
I knew the risks. We all did.
But that wasn't the deal.

55
00:02:53,684 --> 00:02:56,553
And I know for a fact they got
Holt and Perez yesterday.

56
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,723
Now, it's not gonna be me,
but absent the hazard pay,

57
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:01,258
sooner or later,
someone's gonna flip.

58
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:02,926
No one's flipping.

59
00:03:02,961 --> 00:03:05,595
Everyone gets their hazard pay,
including you.

60
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,597
I appreciate what you're
saying and all,

61
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:09,932
but the man is dead.

62
00:03:09,967 --> 00:03:12,935
Okay? The lab's
a hole in the ground.

63
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:15,604
- I just don't see it.
- I've got something new.

64
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,941
It's just starting up.
It's gonna make you whole.

65
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:21,010
Something new?
With the feds looking at you?

66
00:03:21,044 --> 00:03:23,179
- How?
- "How" is my business.

67
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,480
Hanging tight's your business.

68
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:27,182
Your family's gonna be fine.

69
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:29,885
You will be made whole.

70
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,420
Now, you got my word.

71
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,656
You need more?

72
00:03:38,094 --> 00:03:40,194
No, Mike. I'm good.

73
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:44,698
Who's next?

74
00:03:44,732 --> 00:03:46,500
That's your choice.

75
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:48,035
APD's got Martinez across town.

76
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,603
Up in Sandoval.

77
00:03:49,637 --> 00:03:51,705
The Sandia tribal cops
are holding him for the feds.

78
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:56,542
And Holt and Perez
are in lockup in Los Lunas.

79
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,978
You don't mean
to get to them all today?

80
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,613
Yeah, I do.

81
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:03,883
Hey, let's go!
Open up!

82
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:21,416
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

83
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,229
Back here!

84
00:05:08,348 --> 00:05:11,116
Oh, hi.
How was your day?

85
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,322
Um, are-- are you
moving back in?

86
00:05:16,356 --> 00:05:17,323
Yeah.

87
00:05:17,357 --> 00:05:19,558
I'll keep the condo for now,

88
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:22,527
selling it in this market,
I'd get killed.

89
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:25,897
But, yeah, I'm home.

90
00:05:25,932 --> 00:05:27,433
It's time.

91
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:33,171
Do you, uh, really think
that's-- that's a good idea?

92
00:05:34,806 --> 00:05:36,307
Yes.

93
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:09,005
So you bring him here? Come on.
The three of us? We're the three amigos!

94
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,839
All for one, one for all.

95
00:06:10,874 --> 00:06:14,510
We don't need a fourth amigo.

96
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:17,745
Saul, Mike knows the business.
He knows distributors.

97
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:22,183
- Mike's okay. - He's okay? He said
he was gonna break my legs.

98
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:24,552
And don't tell me
he didn't mean it, okay?

99
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:27,622
'Cause he gave me the dead mackerel eyes.
He meant it.

100
00:06:27,656 --> 00:06:30,058
Saul, Mike threatened me.
He threatened Jesse.

101
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,994
He probably threatened someone
before breakfast this morning.

102
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,296
It's what he does.
Come on. Grow a pair.

103
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,003
Let it be noted
that I do this under duress.

104
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:44,371
Duly noted.

105
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:49,208
All right.
Let him in, Huell.

106
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,589
Mike,
I'm extending you the--

107
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,557
Uh-huh.

108
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,694
Now that we're all together,
here are the ground rules...

109
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:13,164
Division of labor--
I handle the business.

110
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:15,533
Making the stuff--
that's your end.

111
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:17,501
I don't tell you how to mix

112
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:19,236
your chemicals and whatnot,

113
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,439
and you do not tell me

114
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,207
how to take care of business.

115
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:26,243
Is that absolutely clear?

116
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,917
Sure.

117
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:35,953
All right.
Let's take the tour.

118
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:43,060
Hey, you're okay with that?

119
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,160
Yes.

120
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,462
He handles the business,

121
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,564
and I handle him.

122
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,371
Clearly, we're talking
about renting, not buying.

123
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:57,974
You need
an ongoing business--

124
00:07:58,008 --> 00:08:00,242
someplace you can slide in,
do your thing,

125
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,576
and remain anonymous.

126
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,244
I'm not gonna mince words.

127
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,246
This is your best bet.

128
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,082
Got machines running,

129
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:09,818
forklifts,
people coming and going.

130
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,821
You're gonna stay
way under the radar.

131
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:14,322
And the owner's solid.

132
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:16,690
He can't wait to throw up
a curtain wall,

133
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:19,392
stack some boxes in front of it,
give you all the space you need.

134
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:22,362
After that, he's got his
business, you've got yours,

135
00:08:22,396 --> 00:08:24,064
and never the twain shall meet.

136
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:26,233
It's outstanding.
Am I right?

137
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,637
Machines like this--
gotta be plenty of power.

138
00:08:29,671 --> 00:08:31,204
What about the smell?

139
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,506
Ah. More good news.

140
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,206
I've been here
when it's up and running.

141
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,809
This place stinks already.
You'll blend right in.

142
00:08:36,844 --> 00:08:38,344
How many employees?

143
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:39,912
Ha. I knew you'd ask.

144
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:42,048
Sixteen illegals,

145
00:08:42,082 --> 00:08:45,317
all highly motivated
to stay deaf, blind and dumb.

146
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,353
You'll want to vet them,
I'm sure.

147
00:08:47,387 --> 00:08:49,454
Yes, indeed.

148
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,389
So what do you say, maestro?

149
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:53,825
Huh?
Is it unanimous?

150
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,528
You know, I worked in a box factory
one summer in high school,

151
00:08:56,562 --> 00:09:00,198
I haven't seen
one of these in years.

152
00:09:00,232 --> 00:09:02,467
Trip down memory lane.
That's perfect.

153
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,835
You know what this is?

154
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,870
It's a corrugator.

155
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:07,638
It uses steam and salt

156
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,071
to crimp kraft paper
for cardboard.

157
00:09:10,297 --> 00:09:13,978
And it makes a hell of * doing it,
which is great, right?

158
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,713
No.

159
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,381
Steam and salt.

160
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:20,817
When this thing is running,
it's like a jungle in here.

161
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:24,954
Shit.
It'll ruin the product.

162
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:27,490
Well, you can't just
hop down to Costco

163
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,659
and get a couple dehumidifiers?

164
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,830
What-- fine. Fine.
Moving on.

165
00:09:38,868 --> 00:09:41,737
Spacious, isolated location,

166
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:43,205
no humidity,

167
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:45,140
and you get all
the free tortillas you want.

168
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:48,877
That's the special feature
of this place.

169
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:50,679
Yeah... I don't know.

170
00:09:50,714 --> 00:09:52,847
It'll make the tortillas
smell like cat piss.

171
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:55,516
Somebody's bound to notice that.

172
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,352
All right. Well, there's gotta be
some kind of workaround, right?

173
00:09:58,386 --> 00:10:01,488
It's a technical problem.
You guys are technical guys.

174
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:03,725
You know, be creative.
Put your heads together.

175
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,659
Anything food-related

176
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,062
is gonna have unannounced
government inspections.

177
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,201
All I'm asking is that
you keep an open mind.

178
00:10:20,356 --> 00:10:23,309
Dennis' already set some spaces
behind these keepball games.

179
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,277
No.

180
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:27,512
Hell, no.

181
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,689
I know it's a long shot.

182
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:40,825
All I can say
to recommend this one

183
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,128
is we're talking about
an owner here who is--

184
00:10:43,162 --> 00:10:45,930
how should I put it--
highly amenable.

185
00:10:49,802 --> 00:10:53,138
Okay. I get it. Just say no,
and we'll go get dinner.

186
00:10:53,172 --> 00:10:55,706
All right.
So I'll start.

187
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:57,440
No way we're cooking in here.

188
00:10:57,475 --> 00:11:00,543
No space,
nowhere for the smell to go.

189
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:02,112
Look at that door.

190
00:11:02,147 --> 00:11:04,248
That thing rolls up,
and we're open to the world.

191
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:06,250
I don't know
if anybody noticed,

192
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,551
but there's a cop shop
a quarter of a mile away.

193
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,553
The hammer comes down,

194
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,790
it's gonna be
custer's last stand.

195
00:11:16,226 --> 00:11:17,894
It's perfect.

196
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,228
What?

197
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:21,831
How are we gonna fit
a lab in here?

198
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:24,734
Who said here?

199
00:11:38,082 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>A house is infested.</i>

200
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:43,552
Termites,
cockroaches, whatever.

201
00:11:43,587 --> 00:11:47,290
Homeowners hire
a pest control company.

202
00:11:47,324 --> 00:11:50,158
Truck rolls up,
homeowners leave.

203
00:11:50,193 --> 00:11:52,327
The crew tents the house.

204
00:11:52,362 --> 00:11:54,963
They bomb the place
with poison.

205
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:57,366
The house stays like that
for days.

206
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,534
No one looks twice
at a tented house.

207
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:02,170
Now, maybe there's a strange
smell coming out of it.

208
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:04,005
Does someone think
to investigate? No.

209
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,508
Anyone go inside?
Hell, no.

210
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,846
And that's where we'll cook.

211
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:18,585
They tent, what,
three, four houses a week?

212
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,853
So we pick the one
that's best for us--

213
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,156
enough floor space,
easy access.

214
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,824
Once the tent is up,

215
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,759
we go in, we cook a batch,

216
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:30,262
we bomb the place, and leave.

217
00:12:30,297 --> 00:12:33,533
So we gotta move
in and out for every cook?

218
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:37,470
Set up the lab, cook,
and then take everything down?

219
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,606
It's challenging but doable.

220
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:43,910
Tell me about these guys.

221
00:12:43,944 --> 00:12:46,812
Uh, Mr. ponytail
on the sidewalk-- that's Ira.

222
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,648
He's the owner.
On the roof is Sandor.

223
00:12:49,682 --> 00:12:51,216
The ladder's Fernando,

224
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:52,884
and down below--
that's Todd.

225
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,553
The pest control operation
is legit.

226
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,322
I mean, they're licensed,
they're bonded,

227
00:12:56,356 --> 00:12:58,623
they do as good a job
as anyone in town,

228
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:02,126
but they're also top-drawer
second-story men.

229
00:13:02,161 --> 00:13:03,328
"Second-story"?

230
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,496
B&E artists.

231
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,498
They're burglars.

232
00:13:07,532 --> 00:13:09,434
Yeah. I mean, hey,
they play it smart.

233
00:13:09,468 --> 00:13:11,802
They don't boost anything
while they're on the job.

234
00:13:11,837 --> 00:13:15,139
They copy the keys, locate
the valuables and alarms,

235
00:13:15,174 --> 00:13:17,574
and they sell that information
to other crews.

236
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:19,409
Or, after a decent interval,

237
00:13:19,444 --> 00:13:21,711
they'll come back and live
for goods themselves.

238
00:13:21,745 --> 00:13:23,646
And you know them how?

239
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:26,383
Oh, I've been pulling their
chestnuts out of the fire,

240
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,885
legally speaking,
for five years.

241
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,553
Ira and his guys are good.

242
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,754
I mean, they know how
to keep their mouths shut.

243
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,890
And if you buy them,
they're gonna stay bought.

244
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,426
You can check
into them yourself.

245
00:13:37,461 --> 00:13:40,896
I will, if it comes to that.

246
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,732
So, do we take a vote?

247
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:48,570
Why?

248
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:26,940
We sound great.
Rock on, man.

249
00:14:26,974 --> 00:14:28,742
Solid.

250
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:31,244
That Yamaha's got
a real nice touch.

251
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,247
You like the sound?
It's huge, huh?

252
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:37,550
Yeah, it's real nice, but we're
looking for something else today.

253
00:14:37,584 --> 00:14:39,084
You got any roadie cases?

254
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:41,086
- For sure, what size?
- Biggest you got.

255
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,689
That'll fit through, like,
a regular-size doorway.

256
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,558
You got it.
Follow me.

257
00:14:48,595 --> 00:14:50,629
Top of the line.

258
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:54,131
Recessed hardware, foam lining,
* walls,

259
00:14:54,166 --> 00:14:56,701
three-inch casters.

260
00:14:56,735 --> 00:14:58,970
Height is good, width is good.

261
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,471
How much weight will this hold?

262
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:02,139
It's rated for 900 pounds.

263
00:15:02,174 --> 00:15:04,609
So unless your band plays lead
bricks, you should be okay.

264
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,013
We're gonna need, uh--

265
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:12,282
Hey, man, I'm trying
to do business over here, bitch.

266
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:16,587
Sorry. He's, like,
overly enthusiastic.

267
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:19,756
Anyway, um,
I'm gonna need four of them.

268
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:21,658
Four?
That gonna be layaway?

269
00:15:21,693 --> 00:15:23,827
I need to see
a bunch of IDs for that.

270
00:15:23,861 --> 00:15:25,494
No, man, cash.

271
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:27,630
Okay. Hey,
uh, you know what?

272
00:15:27,664 --> 00:15:31,500
I'll throw in stenciling.
What's your band called?

273
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:43,144
Damn, brother!

274
00:15:43,178 --> 00:15:46,848
Not asking no questions, but it sure
looks like you're back in business.

275
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:49,651
No joke. You way back
in business, man.

276
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:53,238
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

277
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:56,190
Oh! You're stacking
the benjies

278
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:59,159
- till the rubber band pops.
- Yeah, yeah.

279
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:01,428
All's we're saying is,
we know you're major league now.

280
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:04,464
But if there's ever anything
else you need from us...

281
00:16:04,499 --> 00:16:06,900
Any way we can get in
on this at all.

282
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,336
Little stuff, big stuff...

283
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,839
We would be all over it.

284
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,408
You know, uh, maybe someday.

285
00:16:19,513 --> 00:16:20,980
That's cool.

286
00:16:21,015 --> 00:16:23,082
I guess we better...
hit it then.

287
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:25,151
Yeah. Keep on
keeping on, brother.

288
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,120
Later.

289
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:32,190
Okay, it is the same job as always.

290
00:16:32,224 --> 00:16:33,859
You go out, you inspect,

291
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,394
you deal with the customers,
regular drill.

292
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,063
Everything's the same

293
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:40,932
except for one
important detail.

294
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,274
- No stealing.
- No stealing.

295
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,710
Not a toothpick, not the spare
change between the couch cushions,

296
00:16:52,744 --> 00:16:54,379
not the panties
out of the hamper.

297
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:55,913
Nothing.
And I mean nothing.

298
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,448
And if you're out
with your buddies

299
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,151
and they ask if you got
a hot tip on a B&E,

300
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,818
you tell them you got nada.

301
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:03,820
You're out of the game.
The bottom line is

302
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,723
that these houses are out
of bounds now and forever.

303
00:17:07,157 --> 00:17:09,092
Got it?

304
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:11,094
All right.

305
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:13,930
From time to time,
you're gonna see these two.

306
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:16,533
Now, as far as you're concerned,
they are ghosts.

307
00:17:16,568 --> 00:17:18,634
You don't see them.
You don't hear them.

308
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:20,135
You don't
say "good morning."

309
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,173
You don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

310
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:26,209
On the other hand,

311
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,177
if they tell you to jump,

312
00:17:28,212 --> 00:17:29,978
you don't ask what for,

313
00:17:30,013 --> 00:17:31,480
you jump.

314
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,082
Now, you need a name for them?

315
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:36,985
You call them "yes, sir"
and "no, sir."

316
00:17:39,288 --> 00:17:42,724
You got any problems,
you come to me.

317
00:17:42,758 --> 00:17:44,759
Here's the deal...

318
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:46,794
The finishing tank's
a tight fit.

319
00:17:46,829 --> 00:17:48,863
And with this motor
you've got here on top--

320
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:50,864
The agitation motor.

321
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,799
The agitation motor
here on top,

322
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,502
the tank's not gonna
fit in the box.

323
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:57,338
It's just, uh--
it's just too tall.

324
00:17:57,372 --> 00:17:59,706
Now, I thought we'd
put a collar on the tank

325
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:01,775
and carry
the motor in separately,

326
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:03,477
alongside the condenser.

327
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:05,479
And on the day, we just kind of

328
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:07,613
twist it into place,

329
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:09,749
you know,
while we're setting up.

330
00:18:11,085 --> 00:18:13,353
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

331
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:15,422
- That's good.
- Yeah.

332
00:18:15,456 --> 00:18:17,357
That will work.

333
00:18:17,391 --> 00:18:19,459
And Joe and his guys
can build it, right?

334
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:23,429
Yeah. You know, they're, uh--
they're up for it.

335
00:18:23,463 --> 00:18:26,265
Joe already bought a TIG welder
for the aluminum work.

336
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,200
And, you know,

337
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:30,235
I figure if they
can pull off the magnet,

338
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,237
they can handle this.

339
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:34,506
Now, listen,
about the smell--

340
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,642
about keeping it out of people's
drapes and furniture and whatnot--

341
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,743
when I was down in Mexico,
they, uh--

342
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:43,548
there was this big--
big plastic hospital tent

343
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:46,117
they set up inside of the...

344
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,419
Oh, shit. Sorry.

345
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:51,655
Oh, hi. Sorry.

346
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,757
No, no, no.
We were just, uh, wrapping up.

347
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:55,559
Um, this is my, uh...

348
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:57,360
Friend. Hi. Walt.

349
00:18:57,395 --> 00:18:58,928
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

350
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,931
This is,
uh-- this is Brock.

351
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,733
Hi, Brock. I'm Walt.

352
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,635
I've heard a lot about you.

353
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,137
- Hi.
- Hi.

354
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:08,972
I understand
you were in the hospital

355
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:12,441
and Jesse told me
that you were very brave.

356
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:15,944
Yeah.
A man of few words.

357
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:18,380
I'm sorry. He mostly just
wants to play his game.

358
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:20,182
Oh, I know that.

359
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,719
I have two of my own.
A boy and a girl.

360
00:19:23,753 --> 00:19:26,922
Well, I should, uh--
I should go.

361
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:30,092
I was thinking I could
make us all some dinner.

362
00:19:30,126 --> 00:19:31,827
Are you sure
you don't wanna--

363
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:34,362
Yeah. Won't you stay
for a beer at least?

364
00:19:36,032 --> 00:19:38,466
Sure. Why not?
A beer sounds good.

365
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,752
Thank you.

366
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,502
<i>- How are you today, sir?
- Hello. We're good. Good. How are you?</i>

367
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,537
- Family all packed up,
ready to go? - Yeah.

368
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,242
Okay, here you're acknowledging
that you've removed all pets

369
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,877
and plants from the house
and that food has been removed

370
00:20:48,912 --> 00:20:51,547
- or double-sealed in the bags we provided.
- Uh-huh.

371
00:20:51,582 --> 00:20:53,849
And this acknowledges
that you've removed or bagged

372
00:20:53,883 --> 00:20:55,784
any medicines, tobacco,
and pet foods.

373
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,521
Better make sure you got any medicine you
might need for the next couple of days.

374
00:20:58,555 --> 00:21:00,188
- It's already in the car.
- Okay.

375
00:21:00,223 --> 00:21:03,525
Holy crap. How much
poison are you using?

376
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:06,861
It's not how much, it's getting
it to where it's needed.

377
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:08,597
Those are your foggers.

378
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:10,732
They disperse the fumigate
into the structure

379
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:13,401
where it'll eliminate
any nymphs or larvae

380
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:18,639
as well as the full-grown blattodea.
So, we have all your keys?

381
00:21:18,673 --> 00:21:21,041
Any extras on here
you might wind up needing?

382
00:21:21,075 --> 00:21:22,876
- No. I'm good.
- Okay.

383
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:25,879
This last one here acknowledges
that you have been informed

384
00:21:25,913 --> 00:21:28,449
that you may not
reenter the premises

385
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,717
until it has cleared
the post-fumigation inspection.

386
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,153
So you're gonna
get them all, right?

387
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:36,389
We'll kill 'em dead.
That's a guarantee.

388
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,427
Sir?

389
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,961
Sir?

390
00:22:19,498 --> 00:22:20,963
Yes?

391
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:24,534
There's a nanny-cam
in the living room clock.

392
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,338
I disabled it.
I just thought you should now.

393
00:22:30,107 --> 00:22:31,941
What's your name?

394
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,177
Todd, sir.

395
00:25:30,177 --> 00:25:32,111
<i>Oh!</i>

396
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,647
Cheers.

397
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,289
Mmm.

398
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:46,024
You know, I gotta say,

399
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:50,227
seeing you with Andrea
and that little boy...

400
00:25:50,262 --> 00:25:52,563
It was nice.

401
00:25:52,598 --> 00:25:55,800
- Yeah. It's good right?
- Yeah.

402
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:59,937
Yeah. And the way she looks at you?

403
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:01,372
- Oh-ho.
- You think?

404
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:04,308
Oh, definitely.

405
00:26:08,112 --> 00:26:11,014
So, is it, um--
is it moving

406
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:13,550
in any particular direction?

407
00:26:13,584 --> 00:26:15,318
Uh, I don't know.

408
00:26:15,352 --> 00:26:17,954
Maybe. Yeah. You know,
sometimes I think,

409
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:19,456
you know,

410
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,857
if it feels right, then...

411
00:26:21,892 --> 00:26:23,726
If it feels right,
it feels right.

412
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,496
Sometimes you just
gotta listen to your gut.

413
00:26:27,531 --> 00:26:32,067
I mean, instant family.

414
00:26:32,101 --> 00:26:34,503
What more can you ask, right?

415
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:36,639
Absolutely.

416
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:39,474
<i>Cut the cards.</i>

417
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:43,912
Have you thought about
what your plan is?

418
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:47,749
You know,
vis-a-vis honesty?

419
00:26:47,783 --> 00:26:51,519
What do you mean?
How much she knows about this?

420
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:53,087
Mm.

421
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:54,922
Um...

422
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:58,058
She doesn't know anything.

423
00:26:58,092 --> 00:27:00,360
I mean, you know,
she's not stupid.

424
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,596
She knows
I'm into something, but--

425
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,065
she could make
a pretty good guess.

426
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:07,634
But I never told her anything.

427
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,635
I'm not gonna.

428
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,337
Okay.

429
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,240
I mean it.

430
00:27:15,275 --> 00:27:18,010
I know you do.

431
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:20,513
Jesse, I can't pretend
that this doesn't affect me.

432
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:25,184
It does. But with everything
we've been through

433
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:27,185
the two of us...

434
00:27:28,187 --> 00:27:30,154
This has to be your decision.

435
00:27:30,189 --> 00:27:31,890
I mean, you've earned that.

436
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:35,627
Seriously?

437
00:27:35,661 --> 00:27:37,261
Yeah.

438
00:27:40,733 --> 00:27:43,034
Secrets create barriers

439
00:27:43,068 --> 00:27:45,636
between people.

440
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,339
I'm speaking from experience,
believe me.

441
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,140
All that you've done,

442
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:55,779
it's a part of you, and...

443
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:01,718
I mean, if you choose to spend the
rest of your life with this person,

444
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,822
then you'll have to decide

445
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:09,393
how much you'll share with her.

446
00:28:09,427 --> 00:28:13,630
Meaning what?
Like... everything?

447
00:28:15,965 --> 00:28:18,134
Like Gale?

448
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:28,077
I'm just trying to say
that I trust you,

449
00:28:28,111 --> 00:28:32,013
and I know you'll make
the right call.

450
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:43,391
If she loves you,

451
00:28:43,426 --> 00:28:45,460
she'll understand.

452
00:28:48,563 --> 00:28:51,365
They're leaving streaks.

453
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,034
This more ethnic-looking one--
he's doing a great job.

454
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:56,370
But the other one
is going back and forth

455
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:58,138
like he's scrubbing a wall.

456
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:01,942
They have to go in circles,

457
00:29:01,976 --> 00:29:04,377
or you're going
to leave streaks.

458
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:07,113
That's pretty basic, right?

459
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:10,349
Uh, I don't mean
to tell you your business.

460
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:11,717
It's just-- it's--

461
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,554
it's simple quality control.

462
00:29:17,324 --> 00:29:21,659
So, I've got some good news.

463
00:29:21,694 --> 00:29:23,195
Guess what.

464
00:29:23,229 --> 00:29:25,197
What?

465
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:28,233
No, really.
I want you to guess.

466
00:29:29,403 --> 00:29:31,103
- Really, I really...
- Okay.

467
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,571
Hank's back at work.

468
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:35,306
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

469
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,142
Sure, they love him now, but where
were they when he needed them?

470
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:41,545
Merkert and all the rest-- they just
about laughed him out of the office

471
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,316
when he told them about
that-- that chicken man.

472
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,152
As far as I'm concerned,
too little too late.

473
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:50,588
If it were me,
I'd tell them all to go to hell.

474
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,356
Do I sound bitter?

475
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,325
But it's--
it's what he wants, right?

476
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,293
Yeah, it's doing him good.

477
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,864
I mean, his PT
is going gangbusters.

478
00:30:00,898 --> 00:30:02,799
He's hardly using
his cane at all.

479
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,969
And thank you for that, really.

480
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,438
I mean, God knows where he'd be

481
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:11,341
if we had to go through
his health plan.

482
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,343
I'm just glad
he's feeling better.

483
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:15,345
So, speaking of which,

484
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:17,079
we have another
big event coming up.

485
00:30:17,114 --> 00:30:20,082
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

486
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,084
Walt's birthday.

487
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,686
Whatever you need, I'm here.

488
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,356
Mm, yeah. I, um...

489
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,758
I don't think we're gonna
do anything this year.

490
00:30:29,792 --> 00:30:31,259
What are you talking about?

491
00:30:31,293 --> 00:30:33,928
Of course we're
gonna do something.

492
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:37,532
Skyler, he was diagnosed
around his birthday, right?

493
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:39,200
I...

494
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:41,202
So it's been a whole year.

495
00:30:41,236 --> 00:30:43,638
Listen, I've had
my problems with Walt.

496
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:46,073
Why he wouldn't come to the house
when we were all practically beg--

497
00:30:46,107 --> 00:30:48,142
Whatever.
Water under the bridge.

498
00:30:48,176 --> 00:30:50,778
But at this point, every
year is precious. We are--

499
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:52,412
What are you doing?

500
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:56,249
You don't smoke.

501
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,284
You haven't smoked
since college.

502
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:59,153
You can't be serious!

503
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:01,954
With the baby and Walt?

504
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:03,990
Skyler, you're not smoking
around the baby, are you?

505
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,658
And you can't smoke here.

506
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:08,548
There's gotta be some rule
or regulation, I'm sure.

507
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:11,312
You can't force your
employees to breathe--

508
00:31:11,347 --> 00:31:12,999
I know for a fact
that that is illegal.

509
00:31:13,033 --> 00:31:15,068
Marie, shut up.

510
00:31:15,102 --> 00:31:16,735
What?

511
00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:19,104
I'm sorry. Please don't
speak to me like that.

512
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:21,006
- I am simply saying that you--
- Will you shut up?

513
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,675
- Hey--
- Shut the hell up.

514
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:26,144
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
- Skyler...

515
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,279
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Please stop--

516
00:31:28,314 --> 00:31:30,982
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

517
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:33,117
Shut up! Shut up!

518
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,285
Shut up!

519
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:47,742
That's a 5.23.

520
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:50,078
5.23.

521
00:31:51,247 --> 00:31:52,381
Last one.

522
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,585
5.26.

523
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,687
5.26.

524
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:04,258
That comes to 49.27.

525
00:32:04,293 --> 00:32:06,360
Good yield, right?

526
00:32:06,395 --> 00:32:09,630
That is an excellent yield.

527
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:15,903
All right.

528
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,270
Hey Marie.

529
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,741
How you doing?

530
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,213
Where is Skyler?

531
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:03,781
In the bedroom.
She's resting.

532
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,417
Is everything okay?

533
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,588
Breakdown? What does that--
what does that mean?

534
00:33:09,703 --> 00:33:11,584
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

535
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:15,126
But I've never seen her
like that, ever.

536
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,797
Well, what did she say
when she was yelling?

537
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,865
Nothing.

538
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:25,601
She just yelled, "Shut up, shut up,"
over and over again.

539
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,470
Did you know she's smoking?

540
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:29,405
Occasionally, maybe.

541
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:32,441
It's not a regular thing.

542
00:33:32,476 --> 00:33:35,145
Oh, I just wish
I had gotten your message.

543
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,046
"Messages," Walt.

544
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:40,348
Plural. I probably
called you five times.

545
00:33:44,687 --> 00:33:47,455
I'm not leaving here until I
know what's got her so upset.

546
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:54,629
Are you gambling again?
Is that what this is?

547
00:33:54,664 --> 00:33:57,031
Please, God, tell me
the cancer isn't back.

548
00:33:58,066 --> 00:34:01,869
No. It's not the cancer.

549
00:34:01,904 --> 00:34:03,470
Well, something happened.

550
00:34:03,505 --> 00:34:09,310
I don't mean to point the finger,
but this didn't just come out of nowhere.

551
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:11,577
It's time to tell me
the truth, Walt. All of it.

552
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:14,815
I mean it.

553
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,984
You're right.

554
00:34:25,259 --> 00:34:27,392
You heard about Ted Beneke?

555
00:34:27,427 --> 00:34:29,394
The accident?

556
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:31,163
What accident?

557
00:34:31,198 --> 00:34:33,165
Oh...

558
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,267
Um...

559
00:34:35,302 --> 00:34:37,703
A couple weeks back,

560
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:40,539
Ted took a fall--
a bad one.

561
00:34:40,573 --> 00:34:42,607
He gave himself a concussion,

562
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,243
and, uh, fractured
a couple vertebrae.

563
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:47,411
He's still in the hospital.

564
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:49,347
He may never walk again.

565
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:51,649
Oh, my God.
I-- I didn't--

566
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:54,052
I didn't know.
I'm so sorry to hear that.

567
00:34:54,086 --> 00:34:55,786
Yeah.

568
00:34:56,956 --> 00:35:00,623
But that couldn't explain...
Skyler's--

569
00:35:00,658 --> 00:35:05,863
Uh... Yes.
Yes, it could.

570
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:13,436
You do know, right?
You...

571
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:15,804
You must know.

572
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:20,409
Oh, God.

573
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:25,114
She was having an affair...

574
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:27,116
with Ted Beneke?

575
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,485
Listen, listen.
It wasn't--

576
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,786
it-- it wasn't...

577
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:34,990
ongoing or anything, and...

578
00:35:37,059 --> 00:35:39,027
Well, Skyler and I
have been trying

579
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:41,562
to put things back together.

580
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:47,667
And then-- then the accident
happened, and she got...

581
00:35:50,205 --> 00:35:51,772
Marie, I'm begging you.

582
00:35:51,806 --> 00:35:53,274
Please, keep this to yourself.

583
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:55,509
I don't want Hank
to think less of her...

584
00:35:55,543 --> 00:35:57,211
or me.

585
00:36:00,048 --> 00:36:02,482
When did you, um...

586
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,920
Was she--
I'm gonna go.

587
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:09,521
Okay. All right.

588
00:36:32,244 --> 00:36:33,710
Thank you.

589
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,179
- I'm just...
- Yeah.

590
00:37:08,445 --> 00:37:12,247
<i>Ouch! That looked nasty.</i>

591
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,733
Hey, you okay?

592
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:35,702
I'm good.

593
00:37:38,373 --> 00:37:40,507
Really?

594
00:37:40,541 --> 00:37:42,909
Yeah.

595
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:06,223
<i>Aahh!</i>

596
00:38:12,604 --> 00:38:14,939
<i>Come on. You want</i>
<i>to fuck with me?</i>

597
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:16,574
<i>Okay.</i>

598
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:19,410
<i>You little cockroaches.</i>

599
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:25,482
Okay. Come on.
Wait. Wait for it.

600
00:38:25,517 --> 00:38:27,817
- This is it.
- Wait. Wait for it.

601
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:30,020
Wait.

602
00:38:30,055 --> 00:38:32,423
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>
<i>Okay!</i>

603
00:38:32,457 --> 00:38:34,823
"Say hello to my little friend!"

604
00:38:37,361 --> 00:38:39,495
Nice, just...

605
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:42,165
Hey, mom, uh, feeling better?

606
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,101
Hey. Hey, why don't you join
us, if you feel up to it?

607
00:38:45,135 --> 00:38:48,037
We have popcorn.
I think there's some pizza left.

608
00:38:48,038 --> 00:38:49,338
If you're up to it.

609
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,107
Yeah, mom. Join us.

610
00:38:54,277 --> 00:38:57,479
- Oh, my God. Look. Look.
<i>- You whores!</i>

611
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:59,247
This... oh.

612
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:01,483
Everyone dies in
this movie, don't they?

613
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:05,554
Ahh!

614
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:14,361
Okay.

615
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:18,566
For you and you and me.
367,000 dollars each.

616
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:21,535
Ooh. Wait a minute.

617
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,071
After the dealers
got their cut,

618
00:39:24,105 --> 00:39:30,010
we should be looking
at 1,379,560.

619
00:39:30,011 --> 00:39:32,511
Mike, you're short.

620
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:34,948
You're almost 300,000 short.

621
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,617
You're forgetting
about the mules.

622
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:38,284
They get a flat 20%.

623
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:39,952
- The what?
- The drivers.

624
00:39:39,987 --> 00:39:43,323
They're the ones that take the
product from us to the dealers.

625
00:39:44,391 --> 00:39:48,995
And so, transportation
is worth 20%?

626
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:51,164
They are taking a risk.

627
00:39:52,566 --> 00:39:57,002
$275,000 worth of risk?

628
00:39:57,036 --> 00:40:00,172
Wow.

629
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:02,441
What did Gus pay his mules?

630
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:05,277
Gustavo Fring didn't use mules.

631
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:06,778
He didn't need them.

632
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:09,648
He spent 20 years
building his own distribution.

633
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:13,364
He had 16 refrigerator trucks
running his product.

634
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:15,237
And you know
where they are now?

635
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,655
Government impound.

636
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:20,658
You don't like paying 20%?
Maybe you shouldn't have killed the guy.

637
00:40:20,692 --> 00:40:21,892
Hey, hey, hey.

638
00:40:21,926 --> 00:40:24,228
There's still over
a million bucks here, all right?

639
00:40:24,263 --> 00:40:25,996
That's for one cook.

640
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:28,831
And since you're putting on
the green eyeshade,

641
00:40:28,866 --> 00:40:30,833
my supplier and I
came to an agreement.

642
00:40:30,868 --> 00:40:33,069
The methylamine
was free this time.

643
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:34,571
But brace yourself,

644
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:37,440
because the next barrel
is gonna cost big.

645
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:42,045
Can we continue, or you got
anymore burning questions?

646
00:40:45,582 --> 00:40:47,049
Okay, kid.

647
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:50,719
You fronted us 120,000
to get us going.

648
00:40:50,753 --> 00:40:57,859
So that's 40,000
from him and me.

649
00:40:57,894 --> 00:41:00,127
Yes. Thank you, Jesse.

650
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:01,396
Okay.

651
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,933
Now, Ira gets 110,000
for our piece of the business

652
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,603
and 25,000 per cook.

653
00:41:08,637 --> 00:41:10,672
That is 45,000...

654
00:41:11,674 --> 00:41:13,974
from each of us.

655
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:22,749
Ira's guys get
10,000 each per cook.

656
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:32,425
Goodman's cut--
18,000 from each.

657
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:43,068
Legacy cost--

658
00:41:43,103 --> 00:41:45,404
$351,000.

659
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:47,339
That's 117,000 each.

660
00:41:47,373 --> 00:41:48,806
"Legacy cost"?

661
00:41:48,841 --> 00:41:50,942
I got nine guys.

662
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:53,945
You don't know them, but they were
part of the previous operation,

663
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:55,347
and they know a lot.

664
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:57,249
And right now,
some of them are in jail

665
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:59,117
and more will be soon.

666
00:41:59,151 --> 00:42:01,386
The feds Rico-ed
their hazard pay,

667
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,588
so <i>we</i> are gonna make 'em whole.

668
00:42:04,623 --> 00:42:07,591
<i>"We</i> are gonna make them whole"?

669
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:09,593
What is this "we"?

670
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,962
These were Gus's employees,
not ours.

671
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,231
They might have been
Gus's employees,

672
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,400
but they're my guys.

673
00:42:16,434 --> 00:42:20,431
So what are they doing
to further our interests?

674
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:23,685
The cops are looking
at them very closely.

675
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,010
We don't want them
furthering our interests.

676
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:31,114
So we are paying them, why?

677
00:42:31,149 --> 00:42:35,284
Because it's what you do.

678
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:37,153
Ohh.

679
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,588
It's what you do.

680
00:42:41,925 --> 00:42:44,894
My guys are keeping
their mouths shut.

681
00:42:44,928 --> 00:42:46,829
We make 'em whole.

682
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:49,598
One hand washes the other.
It's as simple as that.

683
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,099
Huh.

684
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,367
It sounds like
a simple shakedown,

685
00:42:53,402 --> 00:42:55,369
simple as that.

686
00:42:55,404 --> 00:42:57,305
We're paying for their silence.

687
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:59,240
That's blackmail.

688
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:03,577
Business is my end.

689
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:06,047
This is business.
End of story.

690
00:43:08,349 --> 00:43:10,383
This is your problem.

691
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:12,319
It should come out of your end.

692
00:43:12,353 --> 00:43:14,922
Hey. Hey.
Just take it out of mine.

693
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:18,859
All right?
Go for it.

694
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:21,995
I don't care.
Just take it.

695
00:43:30,896 --> 00:43:31,929
No...

696
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:33,430
Jesse, thank you,

697
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:35,474
but... no.

698
00:43:35,508 --> 00:43:37,176
I'll pay my share.

699
00:43:38,312 --> 00:43:40,145
Go ahead.

700
00:43:46,018 --> 00:43:47,905
Let me tell you something.

701
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:52,157
This...

702
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,192
is how it's gonna be

703
00:43:54,227 --> 00:43:57,194
from here on out.

704
00:43:57,229 --> 00:44:01,565
My guys are ongoing expenditure

705
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,702
so you best get yourself
comfortable with it.

706
00:44:15,145 --> 00:44:17,947
137,000.

707
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:23,086
That's less than with Fring.

708
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:25,554
Listen, Walter.

709
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:28,623
Just because
you shot Jesse James...

710
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,960
don't make you Jesse James.

711
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,988
Tomorrow.

712
00:44:56,752 --> 00:44:58,586
So how are you feeling?

713
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:00,454
Okay, I guess.

714
00:45:02,624 --> 00:45:05,292
Broke it off with Andrea.

715
00:45:05,326 --> 00:45:07,127
I had to.

716
00:45:07,161 --> 00:45:11,799
She's gonna tell Brock.

717
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:14,301
I'm still gonna take care
of the rent and stuff.

718
00:45:14,335 --> 00:45:16,302
It's the right thing to do,
but, you know--

719
00:45:16,336 --> 00:45:18,037
I meant this.

720
00:45:18,071 --> 00:45:20,773
How are you feeling
about the money?

721
00:45:20,808 --> 00:45:22,875
You're looking at it wrong.

722
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,544
When we worked for Gus,

723
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:26,846
we were cooking
200 pounds a week.

724
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,381
This last batch was great,

725
00:45:29,416 --> 00:45:31,783
but we didn't even
crack 50 pounds.

726
00:45:31,818 --> 00:45:35,386
We maybe cleared less money, but
we got a bigger piece of the pie.

727
00:45:35,421 --> 00:45:39,257
It's like you said,
now we're owners,

728
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:41,225
not employees.

729
00:45:44,363 --> 00:45:47,531
I've been thinking
about Victor.

730
00:45:47,566 --> 00:45:49,299
Yeah?

731
00:45:49,334 --> 00:45:54,071
Yeah. All this time

732
00:45:54,105 --> 00:45:57,307
I was sure that
Gus did what he did

733
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:59,343
to send me a message.

734
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,614
Maybe there's another reason.

735
00:46:04,648 --> 00:46:06,516
Like what?

736
00:46:09,052 --> 00:46:12,087
Victor trying to cook
that batch on his own?

737
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:14,923
Taking liberties
that weren't his to take?

738
00:46:16,526 --> 00:46:20,496
Maybe he flew
too close to the sun,

739
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,664
got his throat cut.

740

<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:11,209
He was out here with those feds...

3
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,640
Shouldn't we maybe find out
what he told them first?

4
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:14,702
Get out.

5
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,003
Put the knife down, please.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,274
- Get out!
- Ah!

7
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:20,774
Ahh!

8
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,106
I need the police.
My dad...

9
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:30,405
<i>You have no right to discuss
anything of what I do.</i>

10
00:00:30,496 --> 00:00:32,069
What the hell do you know
about it anyway?

11
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,432
<i>Nothing!</i>

12
00:00:35,658 --> 00:00:38,824
_

13
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:06,283
You can come on out.

14
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:21,632
It's an actual store.

15
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:23,133
Mm-hmm.

16
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,919
I guess I figured
Vacuum Cleaner Repair

17
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,805
was a term of art.

18
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,646
If you would step right here
on this blue spot.

19
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:38,232
Leave your luggage
where it is for the moment.

20
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,212
That good?

21
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:53,213
Sure.

22
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:54,465
What about this?

23
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:56,667
I'll Photoshop that out.

24
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,561
Oh, Nebraska.
What's in Nebraska?

25
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:11,148
You. From now on.

26
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,317
It's gonna take me some time

27
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:14,818
to get your
new situation fixed.

28
00:02:14,853 --> 00:02:16,603
Until then,
you're gonna be staying here.

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,406
I got a place downstairs,
out of sight.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,658
It's not the Ritz-Carlton,

31
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:23,476
but it's comfortable enough
for short-term.

32
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:25,312
How short-term?

33
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,366
Considering you got your face up on
buses and billboards all over town,

34
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:33,170
I'm thinking, uh, two days.

35
00:02:33,204 --> 00:02:36,507
Maybe three.

36
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,342
Only thing is,

37
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:40,627
and I don't like to do this,

38
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,131
but, uh,
you'll have a bunk mate.

39
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:47,184
Oh, yeah?
He's still here?

40
00:02:47,218 --> 00:02:49,002
For the moment.

41
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,439
He's a special case.
Gonna take some doing.

42
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,895
How's he holding up?

43
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,199
You be the judge.

44
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:23,891
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

45
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:38,810
We will find Hank.

46
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,895
Steve too.

47
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,514
They're out there,
and we're gonna find them.

48
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:45,600
You have my word.

49
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,906
Sir.

50
00:03:58,414 --> 00:04:01,249
Call it in, get her out of here.
Move.

51
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:15,596
<i>I, uh, get to his door,</i>

52
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:18,766
<i>and I could hear music inside.</i>

53
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:20,885
<i>Like squeaky voices.</i>

54
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:23,554
<i>And I thought, you know,</i>

55
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:26,107
<i>maybe, uh...</i>

56
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,943
<i>I knocked on his door.</i>

57
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,346
<i>The music stopped,</i>
<i>and then he was right there.</i>

58
00:04:32,364 --> 00:04:35,783
<i>When he saw the gun,</i>
<i>he thought--</i>

59
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,518
Hey, Kenny.

60
00:04:37,536 --> 00:04:40,822
Does this pussy cry
through the entire thing?

61
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:46,544
Just watch.

62
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,879
<i>Kept saying that...</i>

63
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,213
<i>You know,</i>
<i>"You don't have to do this."</i>

64
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,048
<i>His eyes were so big.</i>

65
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,419
Such a bitch.
He won't quit.

66
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>...high-fiving,</i>
<i>because it worked,</i>

67
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,340
<i>then, you know, we turn around,</i>

68
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:02,260
<i>and there is this kid</i>

69
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:05,596
<i>on a dirt bike, looking at us.</i>

70
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,933
<i>Drew Sharp.</i>

71
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:12,153
<i>That kid that went missing</i>
<i>up in White Horse.</i>

72
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,988
<i>It's him.</i>

73
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,575
<i>And then out of nowhere,</i>

74
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:22,163
<i>Todd, that opie,</i>
<i>dead-eyed piece of shit,</i>

75
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:26,284
<i>pulls out a gun</i>
<i>and shoots the kid.</i>

76
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,452
<i>This is Todd Alquist
we're talking about?</i>

77
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:30,755
<i>He killed Drew Sharp?</i>

78
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,009
<i>Boom.</i>
<i>Like it was nothing.</i>

79
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:47,522
Hey, Uncle Jack.
Hold up.

80
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,026
I think we should keep him
for a while,

81
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,278
get a couple of cooks
under our belt.

82
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:56,814
You seriously giving me
this turn-the-other-cheek crap?

83
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:58,482
He ratted you out.
Personally.

84
00:05:58,534 --> 00:06:00,618
We still got 600 gallons
of methylamine.

85
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,820
Meth?
Who gives a shit about meth?

86
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:03,871
We won the lottery here.

87
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:07,041
We've got all the money
in the world.

88
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,043
You're talking to me
about selling crank?

89
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,962
I mean, this is
millions, Uncle Jack.

90
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:11,996
No matter how much you got,

91
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,465
how do you turn
your back on more?

92
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:22,122
You little...

93
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,675
son of a bitch.

94
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:31,065
It's that Lydia woman.

95
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:34,151
You're sweet on her,
you little bastard.

96
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:35,636
Hey, Kenny, you believe this?

97
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:39,156
Hey, it's all about this
right here, huh?

98
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:43,911
Come on.

99
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,529
You can do better.

100
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:47,365
I mean, that one's so uptight,

101
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,166
she's probably got a wood
chipper for a coochie.

102
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:51,035
You stick it in down there,

103
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:53,204
you're pulling back a stump.

104
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,708
Ah, what the hell.

105
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,394
Heart wants what
the heart wants, right?

106
00:07:03,498 --> 00:07:04,765
Let's go back
and watch some more

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,768
of that crybaby rat, huh?

108
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,857
How thick is it?

109
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:09,997
This is mild steel?

110
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,232
Uh-huh.

111
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,568
Uh, no, this would be cash.

112
00:08:29,434 --> 00:08:31,302
What?

113
00:08:31,353 --> 00:08:33,087
Nothing.

114
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:35,076
Hey, you know what?

115
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,392
Make yourself useful.

116
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:41,261
Give me a list
of hitters, mercenaries.

117
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,398
Yes, yes, I remember.
You've got concerns.

118
00:08:44,432 --> 00:08:47,535
Don't worry. We'll take
the time to vet them.

119
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,906
Make sure there are no
undercover cops on the team.

120
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,324
Five should do it.

121
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,461
Providing they're
the right men for the job.

122
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,446
I'm gonna hate
myself for asking,

123
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:02,550
but, uh, who are we hitting?

124
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:08,556
Jack Welker.
And his men.

125
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,726
They murdered Hank.
They stole my life's work.

126
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,228
I don't know any hit men.

127
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,131
You know a guy who knows a guy.

128
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:20,317
Just get me the contacts.
Anybody in that world.

129
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:25,239
I'm paying top dollar.
We'll find them.

130
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:27,908
You mind if I give you
a nickel's worth of advice?

131
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,310
Just for old time's sake?

132
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:32,446
You're worried about
your wife and kids?

133
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,281
Don't leave.

134
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:35,833
The way things are right now,

135
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,785
some people, not me, mind you,

136
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:39,086
but some people might say

137
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,205
you're leaving her
high and dry.

138
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:44,792
Some people would be
ignorant on the facts.

139
00:09:44,826 --> 00:09:46,660
Some people wouldn't know

140
00:09:46,678 --> 00:09:49,296
that as far as the police
are concerned,

141
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,682
Skyler is a blameless victim.

142
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,437
No, no, no.
Go ahead.

143
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,006
Get it off your chest.

144
00:09:59,024 --> 00:10:00,674
Go on.

145
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:02,526
The phone call
was a smart move.

146
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,561
Kudos to you.

147
00:10:03,612 --> 00:10:05,312
Odds are it was recorded.

148
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,564
It's gonna play great
for a jury.

149
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:08,365
It might even
buy her a mistrial.

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,367
In a year and a half.

151
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,819
Until then,
if they don't have you,

152
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:12,853
they're going after her.

153
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,705
There's no point.
She knows nothing.

154
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,956
Well, too bad for her, then.

155
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,875
She's got nothing to trade.

156
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,493
I hate to be a downer here,

157
00:10:19,527 --> 00:10:21,629
but there are two
DEA agents missing.

158
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:22,863
Presumed dead.

159
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:24,715
You think the feds
are gonna just let that go

160
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,083
'cause you hit
the ejector seat?

161
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:27,551
First thing they're gonna do,

162
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,537
they will RICO your wife
and kids out of the house.

163
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:32,556
That condo is gone.

164
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,391
Your bank accounts,
they're frozen.

165
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,376
Her picture's probably
on TV right now,

166
00:10:36,394 --> 00:10:37,428
next to yours.

167
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,846
Who's gonna hire her?

168
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,980
Money's no problem.

169
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:42,149
Well, I don't mean
to contradict you,

170
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:44,485
but getting it to her,
impossible.

171
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,238
The feds are just praying
that you'll make contact.

172
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,406
Internet, the phone--
it's all tapped.

173
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,109
Hey, Mike was no dummy.

174
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,162
But every time he tried to get his
nest egg to his granddaughter,

175
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:59,250
it ended up
in Uncle Sam's pockets.

176
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,785
So you propose what?

177
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:06,173
Stay. Face the music.

178
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:10,244
Hey, I mean, how much time
have you got left?

179
00:11:10,262 --> 00:11:12,296
You walk in with
your head held high.

180
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:13,747
You'll be the John Dillinger

181
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,249
of the Metropolitan
Detention Center.

182
00:11:15,267 --> 00:11:16,416
How bad is that?

183
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,219
And you bring a barrel
full of drug money,

184
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:21,188
maybe that soothes
some troubled waters.

185
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:23,557
Maybe they let your family
stay in the house.

186
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:27,194
After all, the house predates
the criminal enterprise.

187
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:29,263
God, you think I want to run?!

188
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,233
This is the last thing
that I want.

189
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,368
This-- this changes nothing.

190
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,938
What I do, I do for my family.

191
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:40,374
My money goes to my children.

192
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,442
Not just this barrel.
All of it!

193
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:48,249
I'm going to kill Jack
and his entire crew,

194
00:11:48,283 --> 00:11:50,718
and I'm gonna
take back what is mine

195
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,253
and give it to my children.

196
00:11:52,287 --> 00:11:55,389
And then, and only then...

197
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,057
Am I through.

198
00:11:57,092 --> 00:11:59,310
Do you understand?

199
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,098
Everything good?

200
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:06,016
Define "good."

201
00:12:06,067 --> 00:12:09,103
You're set.
Time to go.

202
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:11,488
You'll be a little longer.

203
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,490
I'm still working
on transportation.

204
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,242
Change of plans.

205
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,493
He's coming with me.

206
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,812
No.
No, that's not--

207
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,367
We're going together.
I can use him.

208
00:12:23,418 --> 00:12:25,786
I'll give you two a minute.

209
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,672
Hey, I'm a civilian.

210
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,007
I'm not your lawyer anymore.

211
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,209
I'm nobody's lawyer.
The fun's over.

212
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,678
From here on out,
I'm Mr. Low Profile.

213
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,330
Just another douche bag
with a job

214
00:12:36,348 --> 00:12:37,514
and three pairs of Dockers.

215
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,882
If I'm lucky, month from now,

216
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,100
best-case scenario,

217
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,019
I'm managing
a cinnabon in Omaha.

218
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,271
You're still part of this.
Whether you like it or not.

219
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,724
I'm sorry.
I don't think so.

220
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:56,317
You remember what I told you?

221
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:59,403
It's not over.

222
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:02,623
Unti...

223
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,476
It's over.

224
00:14:04,446 --> 00:14:07,665
Is she even listening?

225
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:11,052
Mrs. White?

226
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:13,087
Are you following all this?

227
00:14:13,121 --> 00:14:16,591
Do you understand
what's happening here?

228
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:19,427
Yes.

229
00:14:19,461 --> 00:14:22,200
I understand.

230
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:26,815
I understand
I'm in terrible trouble.

231
00:14:27,102 --> 00:14:29,404
I understand that you
will use everything

232
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:33,024
in your power against me
and my children

233
00:14:33,075 --> 00:14:37,362
unless-- unless
I give you Walt.

234
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:41,982
But the truth is,
I can't give you what you want.

235
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,203
I don't know where he is.

236
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:56,180
All right, go and discuss this
with your lawyer here.

237
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:58,199
Rack your brain.

238
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:02,336
And hope you can come up
with something we can use.

239
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,670
<i>4-17?</i>

240
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:22,256
4-17. No activity.

241
00:16:08,036 --> 00:16:12,256
Ma'am, is there anybody
else in the house?

242
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:13,874
What about your son?

243
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:15,843
If I go look in his room,

244
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:17,812
am I gonna see him?

245
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:21,182
He's not gonna pop out
and surprise me?

246
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,150
If this guy
takes his hand away,

247
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:27,054
are you gonna scream?

248
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:31,909
He's at his friend's house.

249
00:16:31,943 --> 00:16:33,894
He's been there all week.

250
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:37,031
Please...
Please don't hurt my baby.

251
00:16:37,065 --> 00:16:39,917
- Please-- please.
- Ma'am.

252
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:43,788
We-- we got a lot
of respect for your husband.

253
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,907
There's just something
that we gotta straighten out.

254
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:50,428
Okay? We know that you've
been talking to the police,

255
00:16:50,462 --> 00:16:51,629
and that's okay.

256
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,464
You gotta do that.

257
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:57,084
But you've seen some people.

258
00:16:57,102 --> 00:17:01,605
Like that lady
who came into the car wash.

259
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,975
The one with the black hair.

260
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:07,594
You said anything about her?

261
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,368
You sure about that?

262
00:17:14,402 --> 00:17:16,954
I didn't.

263
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,241
The police don't need
to know anything about her.

264
00:17:26,665 --> 00:17:29,283
Okay, ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to say it.

265
00:17:29,301 --> 00:17:33,387
I... will... not...

266
00:17:33,421 --> 00:17:38,676
say anything about her.
Ever.

267
00:17:38,727 --> 00:17:40,127
I swear.

268
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:49,687
Okay.

269
00:17:49,738 --> 00:17:51,071
When we leave,

270
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,439
you're not gonna go

271
00:17:52,473 --> 00:17:56,076
running to those
police officers out front?

272
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:59,646
No.

273
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:07,288
Okay. Okay.

274
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,927
'Cause you really
don't want us coming back here.

275
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,312
Don't.
Stay where you are.

276
00:19:05,347 --> 00:19:07,765
We'll talk like this.

277
00:19:10,352 --> 00:19:12,353
Okay.

278
00:19:14,856 --> 00:19:16,991
So that thing
that we talked about,

279
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,576
I went to
Mr. and Mrs. White's house--

280
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,529
You don't...
have to say the name.

281
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:25,666
Sure.

282
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,084
And it went really good.

283
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:31,088
I mean, the message
was received loud and clear.

284
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:35,843
The message? Yeah.

285
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:38,712
Look, I know you did your best.
I just think--

286
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,381
Hi.
What can I get you?

287
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:42,850
Chamomile tea
with soy milk, please.

288
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,885
And I'll need more stevia.

289
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:46,854
Sure.

290
00:19:50,141 --> 00:19:54,194
The person we're discussing
saw my face.

291
00:19:54,229 --> 00:19:55,729
You're not Western Union, Todd.

292
00:19:55,763 --> 00:20:00,567
We can't just settle
for you sending messages.

293
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:01,785
Really, if you'd been there,

294
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,821
I think you'd see it different.

295
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:05,990
We threw a real scare into her.

296
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:10,777
She seems like a nice lady
watching out for her kids.

297
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:12,112
So...

298
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,797
You're not going to have
a problem with her.

299
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:15,282
I can pretty much guarantee it.

300
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,334
I wish I had your certainty,

301
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,253
but I'm not like
you and your uncle.

302
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:23,007
I'm just-- I'm not used
to this kind of risk.

303
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:25,175
We're gonna have
to take a break.

304
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,682
I-- I have 50 pounds
vacuum packed and ready to go.

305
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,736
And I wish you all the luck
in the world with it.

306
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,688
It's 92%.

307
00:20:40,158 --> 00:20:43,243
I'm sorry?

308
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:47,164
92%.

309
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:49,483
Truly?

310
00:20:49,501 --> 00:20:50,484
Tested it twice.

311
00:20:50,502 --> 00:20:53,987
And it's blue.
Just like before.

312
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:58,876
92.
That's Heisenberg level.

313
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:02,429
He's not... with you?

314
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:05,849
Well, next best thing.
Pinkman.

315
00:21:05,884 --> 00:21:08,668
They're looking for Pinkman.

316
00:21:08,687 --> 00:21:10,187
Well, they're not
going to find him.

317
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:13,140
He's with us,
and he's not going anywhere.

318
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:20,447
Ms. Quayle, this is what
your guys in Europe

319
00:21:20,482 --> 00:21:23,200
have been begging for, right?

320
00:21:28,206 --> 00:21:33,193
I just think we work together... good.

321
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:37,664
We make a good team.

322
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:41,668
I think it's kind of...

323
00:21:41,702 --> 00:21:44,671
mutually good.

324
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:49,876
92%.

325
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,112
Ugh.

326
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,847
Mr. Lambert,
welcome to New Hampshire.

327
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:47,541
All right.

328
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:50,160
Let's have a look
at this place.

329
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:53,664
You got about a month's
worth of food on hand,

330
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:55,516
most of it's canned goods,

331
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,885
but there's steaks
in the freezer.

332
00:22:57,936 --> 00:23:00,020
You got a generator outside,

333
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:01,438
works on LP.

334
00:23:01,473 --> 00:23:03,440
Ought to be enough in the tank

335
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:04,675
to last out the winter.

336
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:06,110
It's only 15 amps,

337
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:07,862
but that ought to do
for the lights,

338
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,697
TV, and the freezer.

339
00:23:09,731 --> 00:23:11,699
That's a wood-burner.

340
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:14,184
Ought to warm
the place up pretty good.

341
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:17,037
Plus you can cook on it.

342
00:23:17,072 --> 00:23:18,823
On the TV front,

343
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,125
the reception's
pretty much nil.

344
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:22,877
You got some mountains
in the way.

345
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:26,196
Weather's right, you might
be able to catch Montreal,

346
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:29,199
but mostly you'll be
limited to DVDs.

347
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:33,637
<i>Mr. Magorium's</i>
<i>Wonder Emporium.</i>

348
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:35,873
Two copies.

349
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:39,727
I'm not much of a movie guy.

350
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:42,596
I'll make a supply run
next month.

351
00:23:42,647 --> 00:23:46,734
You want something else
to watch, put it on the list.

352
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:48,652
Supply run.

353
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:52,273
$50,000 for a trip to Costco.

354
00:23:52,324 --> 00:23:53,657
It's risk.

355
00:23:53,692 --> 00:23:56,110
And risk is what
you're paying me for,

356
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:57,745
not toilet paper.

357
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,582
Risk and a 4,400-mile
round trip.

358
00:24:01,616 --> 00:24:05,736
Mr. Lambert,
my clients and I

359
00:24:05,754 --> 00:24:08,339
don't usually have
an ongoing relationship.

360
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:11,792
Normally, you and I would have
already gone our separate ways,

361
00:24:11,843 --> 00:24:14,511
but you're you.

362
00:24:17,215 --> 00:24:18,549
Where's the phone?

363
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:19,850
No phone.

364
00:24:19,885 --> 00:24:24,221
Up here, ice storms
equal service calls,

365
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:26,857
equal you in cuffs.

366
00:24:26,892 --> 00:24:28,392
Internet?

367
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:29,727
Same deal.

368
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:34,315
Also satellite, cable TV,
drop phone, car.

369
00:24:34,366 --> 00:24:37,952
You want news, I'll bring
the Albuquerque papers.

370
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,787
Whatever you need, just...

371
00:24:39,821 --> 00:24:40,955
- put it on the list.
- Put it on the list.

372
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:41,956
Yeah.

373
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,493
Look,
I have business to conduct.

374
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:49,780
Your business is your business.

375
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,050
My business is keeping
you out of custody.

376
00:24:53,084 --> 00:24:56,387
You are the target
of a nation-wide manhunt.

377
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,389
Your face is all over TV.

378
00:24:58,423 --> 00:25:01,058
You are the hottest client
I have ever had.

379
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:03,510
By <i>far.</i>

380
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:05,479
It stands to reason

381
00:25:05,513 --> 00:25:09,183
you've got to keep
out of sight.

382
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:12,686
And what's keeping me
from walking out that gate?

383
00:25:12,737 --> 00:25:14,688
Nothing.

384
00:25:14,739 --> 00:25:16,941
There's a little
one-horse town

385
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,575
eight miles down the hill.

386
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,577
There's not a thing
on God's green Earth

387
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:23,647
that I can do to stop you
going down there.

388
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:25,315
All I'm saying is,

389
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,285
if you leave this place,

390
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,038
you will get caught.

391
00:25:31,089 --> 00:25:33,257
And, I gotta tell you,

392
00:25:33,291 --> 00:25:37,594
if I find out that
you've left the reservation,

393
00:25:37,629 --> 00:25:39,463
I won't be coming back.

394
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:41,665
That is for my own safety.

395
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:45,686
You understand?

396
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,672
Sure.

397
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,173
You know how to work the stove?

398
00:25:50,191 --> 00:25:51,508
- The flue can be tricky.
- Yeah.

399
00:25:51,526 --> 00:25:53,277
I got it.

400
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,284
You paid good money for this.

401
00:26:00,318 --> 00:26:01,735
You got two acres up here,

402
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:04,021
lots of woods,
nice, warm place.

403
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,373
Seems to me just the spot

404
00:26:06,408 --> 00:26:10,544
for a man to rest up,
think on things.

405
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:15,699
If you look around,
it's kinda beautiful.

406
00:26:15,717 --> 00:26:19,420
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

407
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:21,305
See you in a month.

408
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,154
Tomorrow.

409
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:05,692
Tomorrow.

410
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:56,293
Come--

411
00:29:04,219 --> 00:29:07,137
That's not my chocolate
chip, is it?

412
00:29:07,172 --> 00:29:09,473
You're gonna spoil him.

413
00:29:13,728 --> 00:29:15,512
Hey, you awake?

414
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:18,649
Huh? Yeah.

415
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:21,652
We had some Ben and Jerry's.

416
00:29:21,686 --> 00:29:27,357
There's peanut butter cup
and "Americone Dream."

417
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,442
I didn't know what you liked,

418
00:29:28,493 --> 00:29:30,410
so I got you some of each.

419
00:29:33,915 --> 00:29:36,200
There you go.

420
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:52,216
So that batch that you
just cooked was 96%.

421
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,086
Kinda figured you deserved
a little something.

422
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:59,690
Thanks.

423
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:17,124
Well, better get some sleep.

424
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:20,110
Tomorrow's gonna be a big day.

425
00:30:20,128 --> 00:30:21,878
Got a whole new batch.

426
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,997
Hey, um, Todd.

427
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:25,332
Yeah?

428
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:30,337
Would you mind, uh,
leaving the tarp off tonight?

429
00:30:30,388 --> 00:30:32,089
Well, might get cold.

430
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:33,456
No, I-- I don't mind.

431
00:30:33,474 --> 00:30:36,960
I just...
I just wanna see the stars.

432
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:43,317
Sure. Okay.

433
00:30:43,351 --> 00:30:45,819
Thanks.

434
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:50,073
Well, goodnight, Jesse.

435
00:30:50,108 --> 00:30:52,492
Night.

436
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:52,586
Okay. Okay. Okay.

437
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:28,755
Come on. Bitch.

438
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:21,725
Go ahead! Do it!

439
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,960
Just kill me now
and get it over with,

440
00:33:23,978 --> 00:33:25,295
because there's no way

441
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:26,930
I'm doing one more cook

442
00:33:26,964 --> 00:33:29,015
for you psycho fucks!

443
00:33:48,336 --> 00:33:49,619
Yes?

444
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,987
Hi, ma'am.
How you doing tonight?

445
00:33:51,005 --> 00:33:53,156
Um, you're Andrea, right?

446
00:33:53,174 --> 00:33:55,375
How can I help you?

447
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:58,428
You know Jesse Pinkman?

448
00:33:58,463 --> 00:34:00,163
Right?
Well, I'm a friend of his.

449
00:34:00,181 --> 00:34:01,798
My name's Todd.

450
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:03,683
I'm sorry to bother you
so late,

451
00:34:03,718 --> 00:34:07,721
but it's nice to meet you.

452
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,894
How is Jesse? Is he okay?

453
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:15,678
Yeah, he's okay.

454
00:34:15,696 --> 00:34:18,031
Actually,
I brought him with me.

455
00:34:18,065 --> 00:34:19,449
Jesse's here?

456
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:21,902
Yeah, he's right...
over there.

457
00:34:21,953 --> 00:34:23,987
In that truck.

458
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,883
Where?

459
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,470
No!

460
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:47,143
Just so you know,
this isn't personal.

461
00:34:48,646 --> 00:34:50,880
No!

462
00:35:10,368 --> 00:35:13,503
Whoa. Hey.
Settle down.

463
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,507
Settle down.

464
00:35:17,542 --> 00:35:19,409
Hey, remember.

465
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:21,595
There's still the kid.

466
00:36:22,457 --> 00:36:24,958
I brought you a couple
of cases of ensure.

467
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,560
Maybe put a little
weight on you.

468
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:28,062
Jesus.

469
00:36:28,096 --> 00:36:30,097
I can barely read this.

470
00:36:30,131 --> 00:36:32,232
Ah. Almost forgot.

471
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:34,134
Without a prescription,

472
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,103
I had to take an educated
guess and shotgun it.

473
00:36:36,137 --> 00:36:37,571
One of these
ought to come close.

474
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:39,606
Oh.

475
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,994
Did you, uh, check on them?

476
00:36:44,029 --> 00:36:45,979
Is Skyler in a better place?

477
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:49,366
Nah, she's still at that
place off of Eubank.

478
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:51,752
Kids are both still
with her for the moment.

479
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:54,371
Uh, there's no court date yet.

480
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:56,924
The news was talking
about a grand jury,

481
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:59,159
but they didn't say when.

482
00:36:59,177 --> 00:37:02,513
I saw her
public defender on TV.

483
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:05,165
Looks like a deer
in the headlights.

484
00:37:05,183 --> 00:37:09,770
Think I got socks
older than him.

485
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:12,389
What are they doing for money?

486
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,192
She's doing
taxi dispatch part-time.

487
00:37:15,226 --> 00:37:19,363
Leaves the baby with a
neighbor when she goes in.

488
00:37:19,397 --> 00:37:21,398
I saw her shopping one time.

489
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,117
She looks pretty good.

490
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:25,736
And she's using
her maiden name.

491
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:28,122
I wouldn't take that personally

492
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,740
under the circumstances.

493
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:31,375
Those working for you?

494
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:33,693
Oh, yeah.

495
00:37:33,712 --> 00:37:36,080
I took a run by your old house.

496
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:38,048
Uh, the auction's
still pending.

497
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:40,134
They put a fence up around it.

498
00:37:40,168 --> 00:37:41,385
They put up a fence?

499
00:37:41,419 --> 00:37:42,536
Seems like the place

500
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:44,638
got to be kind of
a tourist attraction.

501
00:37:44,672 --> 00:37:46,256
Kids breaking in.

502
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:47,374
The neighbors complained,

503
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,876
so the bank put up a fence.

504
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,150
You ready?

505
00:37:56,184 --> 00:37:58,318
Hmm?

506
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:03,323
Yeah.

507
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:09,062
Sorry about last time.

508
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,198
It should go better now.

509
00:38:11,232 --> 00:38:15,068
I watched a couple
of YouTube videos.

510
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:18,422
It's all about
finding the vein.

511
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:22,042
Give it to me.
I'll do it.

512
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:38,559
Here.
You-- you do it.

513
00:38:41,112 --> 00:38:42,596
Big fist.

514
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:43,979
Tight. There we go.

515
00:38:45,271 --> 00:38:46,655
All right.

516
00:38:46,706 --> 00:38:49,207
It's just...

517
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:50,709
little stick.

518
00:38:50,743 --> 00:38:52,410
That's it. Okay. Hey.

519
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:55,247
Pretty good.
There you go.

520
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,669
Think I had worse
my last physical.

521
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,092
I will see you on...

522
00:39:07,126 --> 00:39:09,261
Let's see.

523
00:39:09,295 --> 00:39:13,849
Afternoon of the 15th.

524
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,401
Stay a little longer?

525
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:21,306
Yeah, I got a long trip
ahead of me.

526
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:24,993
Two hours?

527
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:29,981
I'll-- I'll give you
another $10,000.

528
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:38,340
Please.

529
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:43,929
$10,000.

530
00:39:43,963 --> 00:39:45,997
One hour.

531
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:52,771
Cards?

532
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,028
All right, well...

533
00:40:00,062 --> 00:40:04,783
The game will be Seven Card.

534
00:40:04,817 --> 00:40:09,070
I'll deal, since you are...

535
00:40:09,121 --> 00:40:11,189
encumbered.

536
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:22,884
One of these days
when you come up here...

537
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,502
I'll be dead.

538
00:40:27,706 --> 00:40:30,342
My money over there.

539
00:40:30,376 --> 00:40:34,563
What happens to it then?

540
00:40:34,597 --> 00:40:39,317
What if I ask you
to give it to my family?

541
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:48,743
Would you do it?

542
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:56,418
If I said yes...

543
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:58,787
would you believe me?

544
00:41:09,432 --> 00:41:11,132
You wanna cut the cards?

545
00:41:14,253 --> 00:41:16,087
No.

546
00:41:22,728 --> 00:41:24,396
A king.

547
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,364
Two kings.

548
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:35,406
_

549
00:44:07,357 --> 00:44:09,525
<i>Flynn White to the
Principal's office, please.</i>

550
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:21,137
I'm sorry to pull you
out of class.

551
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:22,838
It's your Aunt Marie.

552
00:44:22,872 --> 00:44:25,374
It sounds very important.

553
00:44:25,392 --> 00:44:27,393
You can take it in here, okay?

554
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:28,427
Okay.

555
00:44:28,478 --> 00:44:31,264
Here he is.

556
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:33,015
Thank you.

557
00:44:33,049 --> 00:44:35,234
Hey, Aunt Marie.

558
00:44:35,269 --> 00:44:37,603
Um, what's--
what's going on?

559
00:44:37,654 --> 00:44:39,488
Hold on a sec, honey.

560
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:48,698
<i>Son, it's me.</i>
<i>Please don't let on.</i>

561
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:49,999
<i>Carmen's nearby, right?</i>

562
00:44:50,083 --> 00:44:51,617
<i>She cannot know.</i>

563
00:44:51,668 --> 00:44:54,537
<i>Son, are you there?</i>

564
00:44:54,571 --> 00:44:56,839
Ye-- yes.

565
00:44:58,425 --> 00:45:00,843
It's so good
to hear your voice.

566
00:45:03,913 --> 00:45:05,431
I-- I...

567
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:09,051
I, uh...

568
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:14,106
Son, the things
that they're saying...

569
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:17,393
<i>about me...</i>
<i>I did wrong.</i>

570
00:45:17,427 --> 00:45:20,813
<i>I-- I made</i>
<i>some terrible mistakes.</i>

571
00:45:20,864 --> 00:45:25,284
But the reasons were always...

572
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:31,741
Things happened that...

573
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,110
I-- I never... intended.

574
00:45:35,128 --> 00:45:37,663
I never intended.

575
00:45:42,052 --> 00:45:43,919
Listen.

576
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:46,555
Son, we don't have much time.

577
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,227
Is Louis' family
still at 4848 Newcombe?

578
00:45:51,261 --> 00:45:54,597
<i>Son, your friend,</i>
<i>Louis Corbett,</i>

579
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:56,832
<i>does his family still</i>
<i>live in that same place</i>

580
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,302
<i>up on Newcombe?</i>

581
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:00,336
Ye-- yes.

582
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,470
<i>Okay, good.</i>

583
00:46:01,488 --> 00:46:03,606
Okay,
he's-- he's a good kid.

584
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,358
He's-- he's like you.
He'll understand.

585
00:46:05,409 --> 00:46:08,277
<i>I'm sending Louis a package.</i>

586
00:46:08,311 --> 00:46:12,114
<i>Now, it's addressed to Louis,</i>
<i>but it's for you.</i>

587
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:16,585
<i>Your mother and your sister.</i>

588
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:19,672
There's--
there's money inside.

589
00:46:19,706 --> 00:46:25,177
About $100,000.
Okay?

590
00:46:25,212 --> 00:46:27,430
I think.

591
00:46:27,464 --> 00:46:30,883
<i>It was all that</i>
<i>I could fit into the box.</i>

592
00:46:30,934 --> 00:46:32,518
<i>It has to be a secret.</i>

593
00:46:32,552 --> 00:46:33,969
And if anyone says a word,

594
00:46:34,003 --> 00:46:36,188
the police will take it.

595
00:46:46,566 --> 00:46:49,869
<i>I wanted to give you</i>
<i>so much more.</i>

596
00:46:49,903 --> 00:46:52,238
<i>But this is all I could do.</i>

597
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:54,740
Do you understand?

598
00:46:58,879 --> 00:47:01,414
Son?

599
00:47:01,465 --> 00:47:04,417
Can you hear me?
Do you understand?

600
00:47:07,537 --> 00:47:10,389
You want to send money?

601
00:47:10,424 --> 00:47:11,974
Yes. Good.

602
00:47:12,008 --> 00:47:15,478
Good, good.

603
00:47:15,512 --> 00:47:18,180
So you'll--
you'll talk to Louis, right?

604
00:47:18,214 --> 00:47:20,733
You killed Uncle Hank.

605
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:21,884
You killed him!

606
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:24,219
Wait. Wait, son.

607
00:47:24,237 --> 00:47:27,523
No.
What you did to mom-- you asshole.

608
00:47:27,557 --> 00:47:29,075
You killed Uncle Hank.

609
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:30,693
Listen to me.
You've got to listen to me.

610
00:47:30,727 --> 00:47:32,745
<i>Just shut up.</i>
<i>Just stop it.</i>

611
00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:34,246
Sto-- stop it.

612
00:47:34,281 --> 00:47:36,064
<i>I don't want anything from you.</i>

613
00:47:36,083 --> 00:47:38,084
I don't give a shit.

614
00:47:38,118 --> 00:47:39,418
You need this money.
Your mother--

615
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:40,953
<i>You killed Uncle Hank.</i>
<i>You killed him!</i>

616
00:47:41,004 --> 00:47:42,671
Your mother needs this money.

617
00:47:42,706 --> 00:47:43,789
It can't all be for nothing.

618
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,374
<i>What you did--</i>
<i>Just shut up.</i>

<i>Will you just--</i>
<i>just leave us alone.</i>

You asshole!

623
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:55,134
Why are you still alive?

624
00:47:55,185 --> 00:47:57,586
<i>Why don't you just--</i>
<i>just die already?</i>

625
00:47:57,604 --> 00:47:59,939

<i>Andrew Ross Sorkin</i>
<i>of</i> The New York Times

656
00:50:36,707 --> 00:50:39,476
<i>wrote a column suggesting</i>

657
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:43,913
<i>that the grant was a kind</i>
<i>of publicity maneuver</i>

658
00:50:43,948 --> 00:50:47,550
<i>to sure up the stock price</i>
<i>of Gray Matter Technologies</i>

659
00:50:47,585 --> 00:50:52,889
<i>because of your association</i>
<i>with Walter White.</i>

660
00:50:52,923 --> 00:50:54,357
<i>Well, that's not</i>
<i>exactly the way--</i>

661
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:56,259
<i>To cleanse yourselves,</i>
<i>so to speak,</i>

662
00:50:56,293 --> 00:50:59,562
<i>of having</i>
<i>a methamphetamine kingpin</i>

663
00:50:59,597 --> 00:51:02,565
<i>as cofounder of your company.</i>

664
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,200
<i>Charlie, I'm glad</i>
<i>you brought that up.</i>

665
00:51:04,235 --> 00:51:07,437
<i>I have to believe</i>
<i>that the investing public</i>

666
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:09,305
<i>understands we're talking</i>
<i>about a person</i>

667
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,307
<i>who-- who was there early on,</i>

668
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:12,542
<i>but who had virtually</i>

669
00:51:12,576 --> 00:51:14,377
<i>nothing to do with</i>
<i>the creation of the company,</i>

670
00:51:14,411 --> 00:51:15,545
<i>and still less to do</i>

671
00:51:15,579 --> 00:51:17,146
<i>with growing it</i>
<i>into what it is today.</i>

672
00:51:17,181 --> 00:51:20,483
<i>So what was Walter White's</i>
<i>contribution?</i>

673
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:24,587
<i>You know, to be honest...</i>
<i>Honey?</i>

674
00:51:24,622 --> 00:51:26,723
<i>- The company name.</i>
<i>- The company name.</i>

675
00:51:26,757 --> 00:51:29,592
<i>We came up with it</i>
<i>by combining our names.</i>

676
00:51:29,627 --> 00:51:31,060
<i>Uh, "Schwartz" means black,</i>

677
00:51:31,095 --> 00:51:32,695
<i>black plus White makes gray.</i>

678
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:34,430
<i>It's Gray Matter Technologies.</i>

679
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:36,332
<i>Exactly.</i>
<i>As far as I can recall,</i>

680
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:38,735
<i>his contribution begins</i>
<i>and ends right there.</i>

681
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:40,503
<i>There are continuing reports</i>

682
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:42,272
<i>of blue methamphetamine,</i>

683
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:45,675
<i>considered his signature product</i>
<i>throughout the Southwest,</i>

684
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:49,112
<i>and some evidence</i>
<i>of reaching as far as Europe.</i>

685
00:51:49,146 --> 00:51:50,813
<i>So my question is,</i>

686
00:51:50,848 --> 00:51:53,883
<i>is Walter White</i>
<i>still out there?</i>

687
00:51:53,918 --> 00:51:55,985
<i>No, he's not.</i>

688
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:59,722
<i>You sound very sure.</i>

689
00:51:59,757 --> 00:52:00,990
<i>I am.</i>

690
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:03,726
<i>I can't speak</i>
<i>to this Heisenberg</i>

691
00:52:03,761 --> 00:52:06,296
<i>that people refer to,</i>

692
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:08,998
<i>but whatever--</i>

693
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,433
<i>whatever he became,</i>

694
00:52:10,467 --> 00:52:13,269
<i>the-- the sweet, kind,</i>
<i>brilliant man</i>

695
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:17,173
<i>that we once knew,</i>
<i>long ago, he's gone.</i>

696
00:52:17,207 --> 00:52:19,275
<i>But to be absolutely clear...</i>

697

698
00:52:47,938 --> 00:52:48,938

00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:03,040
Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:05,889
I had the cigarette with the ricine
in my pack this morning!

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:08,043
Why did you poison him?
Admit it!

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:09,495
I did not do this!

5
00:00:09,768 --> 00:00:11,708
Now, this here, is a partial number...

6
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:15,190
Manufactured by a big
international concern...

7
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:17,669
Madrigal Electromotive.

8
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:20,316
Check it out,
that's not on the manifest.

9
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:23,424
We're done when
I say we're done.

10
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:25,561
If you have any brains
you'll skip town.

11
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:26,763
I am scared.

12
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,762
Scared?
Scared of what?

13
00:00:28,868 --> 00:00:29,869
You.

14
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,289
Honey mustard.

00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,342
<i>Honest to God, it's starting</i>
<i>to drive me crazy.</i>

17
00:06:09,376 --> 00:06:10,343
<i>Well, don't.</i>

18
00:06:10,377 --> 00:06:11,845
<i>It keeps me awake at night.</i>

19
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,380
<i>I lay there thinking, "Where is it?
Where did it go?"</i>

20
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:18,484
<i>- And I just-- You know, I can't even--
- Jesse, Jesse, Jesse, look...</i>

21
00:06:18,518 --> 00:06:21,253
<i>Doesn't it make sense</i>
<i>that it wound up in the lab?</i>

22
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:24,090
<i>I thought about that a lot.</i>
<i>But I just don't see how.</i>

23
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,225
<i>Well, look.</i>
<i>You had the pack</i>

24
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,793
<i>in your pocket</i>
<i>of your jacket, right?</i>

25
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:30,442
<i>- Yeah.
- And your jacket was in your locker,</i>

26
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,964
<i>so maybe the cigarette
just fell out of the pocket</i>

27
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,933
<i>and wound up in the locker,</i>
<i>and now it's all burned up.</i>

28
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,835
<i>- It's gone.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

29
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,872
<i>But I don't know that,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

30
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:43,108
<i>I can't ever know for sure.</i>

31
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:48,345
<i>Well, look, did you</i>
<i>check your house?</i>

32
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,280
<i>Did you-- Maybe it's</i>
<i>somewhere in your house.</i>

33
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:52,383
<i>No, man.</i>
<i>I've looked everywhere, okay?</i>

34
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,384
<i>Your car?</i>
<i>Did you check your car?</i>

35
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:54,985
<i>No, no--</i>

36
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,022
<i>- Thoroughly? - Yes, of course.</i>
<i>Look, it's not in my house.</i>

37
00:06:58,056 --> 00:07:00,190
<i>It's not in my car.
And the more I think about it,</i>

38
00:07:00,225 --> 00:07:02,191
<i>there's no way</i>
<i>it fell out in my locker.</i>

39
00:07:02,226 --> 00:07:04,127
<i>And I keep thinking somebody's</i>
<i>gonna find this thing</i>

40
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,995
<i>- on the street or something.</i>
<i>- You don't know that.</i>

41
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,930
<i>- Somewhere where I dropped it.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

42
00:07:07,964 --> 00:07:09,432
<i>Some innocent person,</i>
<i>some kid maybe, even.</i>

43
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,966
<i>No. No. Come on.</i>

44
00:07:11,001 --> 00:07:13,369
<i>And they're gonna pick
it up, and it's gonna--</i>

45
00:07:13,404 --> 00:07:14,370
<i>You're working yours--/i>
- Oh, my God!</i>

46
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:15,704
<i>Jesse, listen.</i>

47
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,206
<i>You've gotta get</i>
<i>ahold of yourself here.</i>

48
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:19,207
<i>All right? I'll tell you</i>
<i>what I'm gonna do.</i>

49
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,909
<i>I'm gonna</i>
<i>come over there, okay?</i>

50
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:23,011
<i>And together, we're gonna</i>
<i>look for this thing.</i>

51
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:25,514
<i>- All right?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

52
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,289
Ohh.

53
00:09:30,966 --> 00:09:33,268
What the hell is that?

54
00:09:33,302 --> 00:09:35,302
My Roomba.

55
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,041
I already checked it.

56
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:44,278
When?

57
00:09:44,312 --> 00:09:46,446
Like, a week ago.

58
00:10:05,732 --> 00:10:07,732
Oh, God.

59
00:10:09,768 --> 00:10:11,769
Oh, Jesus.

60
00:10:13,706 --> 00:10:15,540
Okay. Easy, easy.
Take it--

61
00:10:15,575 --> 00:10:18,076
Careful.
Let me see.

62
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,212
Is it still intact?

63
00:10:21,214 --> 00:10:22,514
Yeah. Good.

64
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:24,515
Good. No worries.

65
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,550
Let me get rid of this.

66
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,766
What luck.

67
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,160
Whoo.

68
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:41,631
Well, I don't know about you,

69
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,833
but I, for one,
could use a beer.

70
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,968
You have any?

71
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,673
Jesse?

72
00:10:54,478 --> 00:10:56,678
I almost shot you.

73
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:58,213
Hey, hey, now...

74
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:01,416
I almost killed you
all because...

75
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,653
Listen.

76
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:07,422
It was just a--
A misunderstanding, that's all.

77
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,458
No. No, no, no, no.

78
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:15,429
I don't know what's wrong
with me, Mr. White.

79
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:16,964
- I...
- Hey.

80
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:20,735
I don't know how
I could be so stupid.

81
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:22,270
Stop that now.
Come on.

82
00:11:22,304 --> 00:11:24,405
Come on. Come on.

83
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:29,108
I'm so sorry.

84
00:11:29,143 --> 00:11:31,144
It's okay.

85
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:33,012
It's okay.

86
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,849
Listen to me.

87
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:39,919
What happened,
happened for the best,

88
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:41,954
you hear me?

89
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:44,556
I wouldn't change a thing.

90
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:47,693
You and I working together,

91
00:11:47,727 --> 00:11:50,562
having each other's back.

92
00:11:50,597 --> 00:11:52,798
It's what saved our lives.

93
00:11:56,869 --> 00:11:59,004
I...

94
00:11:59,038 --> 00:12:02,540
I want you to think about
that as we go forward.

95
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:12,249
Go forward where?

96
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,986
Ohh.

97
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:18,988
<i>Stillwell, steady as she goes.</i>

98
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,156
Ohh.

99
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:21,825
<i>Willie, note the time.</i>

100
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:22,859
Whoo.

101
00:12:24,796 --> 00:12:26,196
- Ohh.
<i>- Captain, I'm sorry,</i>

102
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,864
<i>- but you're a sick man.</i>
- Mmm.

103
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:29,866
<i>I'm relieving you</i>
<i>as captain of the ship</i>

104
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,635
<i>under article 184.</i>

105
00:12:31,669 --> 00:12:33,803
- Oh, God. <i>- I don't know what</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

106
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,272
<i>- Helmsman, left 180.</i>
- Ohh.

107
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:39,309
<i>Mr. Keith, what do I do?</i>

108
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,712
<i>I told you to come left.</i>
<i>Now come left, and fast.</i>

109
00:12:42,746 --> 00:12:44,214
<i>I'm sorry, sir,</i>

110
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:46,349
<i>but you're not issuing orders</i>
<i>on this bridge anymore.</i>

111
00:12:46,383 --> 00:12:47,950
<i>I've relieved you.</i>

112
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:49,318
<i>I take full responsibil--</i>

113
00:12:52,501 --> 00:12:53,813
<i>Thanks for seeing us.</i>

114
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,561
We're here to talk partnership.

115
00:12:59,595 --> 00:13:01,730
Partnership.

116
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:03,732
Yes. Equal.
Three ways--

117
00:13:03,766 --> 00:13:08,002
You, Jesse and me.

118
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:11,305
Well, we figure we're gonna
start cooking again.

119
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,374
You know, we figure, why not?

120
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:16,510
There's no denying the
popularity of our product.

121
00:13:16,544 --> 00:13:18,579
There's a market to be filled,

122
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:22,582
- and currently no one to fill it.
- A lot of money to be made...

123
00:13:22,616 --> 00:13:26,186
And obviously, Jesse and I
have manufacture covered.

124
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,589
But there's still distribution,

125
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:32,658
support, logistics,
that sort of thing.

126
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:36,128
For instance, we'll need a
steady supply of precursor.

127
00:13:36,162 --> 00:13:39,031
With your experience
and connections,

128
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:40,966
you would be a great help.

129
00:13:41,001 --> 00:13:42,001
Mmm.

130
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:44,703
Granted, there's
a lot of work ahead.

131
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,205
There's a lot of rebuilding.

132
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:50,042
And, no doubt,
our profits will be smaller.

133
00:13:50,076 --> 00:13:51,543
At least at first.

134
00:13:51,577 --> 00:13:55,280
But each of us
will receive a larger cut.

135
00:13:55,314 --> 00:13:58,883
Owners, not employees.

136
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:04,688
Thanks, but no, thanks.

137
00:14:08,793 --> 00:14:10,093
Mike,

138
00:14:10,128 --> 00:14:12,729
I know you don't care for me.

139
00:14:12,763 --> 00:14:17,434
We've had our issues,
you and I.

140
00:14:17,468 --> 00:14:19,202
I would suggest

141
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:21,805
that you leave emotion
out of this decision.

142
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,340
I am.

143
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,308
You...

144
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:28,811
are trouble.

145
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:33,282
I'm sorry the kid here doesn't
see it, but I sure ash hell do.

146
00:14:33,317 --> 00:14:36,618
You are a time bomb...

147
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:39,755
tick, tick, ticking,

148
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,992
and I have no intention
of being around for the boom.

149
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:55,537
Well, sleep on it.

150
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,572
Maybe you'll reconsider.

151
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,874
In the meantime,

152
00:14:59,908 --> 00:15:02,076
we're pressing on.

153
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,758
Morning.

154
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:25,832
Hey, why aren't you upstairs?

155
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:29,434
- I came to see if you needed any help.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

156
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,737
Well, I can see that, man.
It's outstanding.

157
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,405
Yeah.
I'm working on it here.

158
00:15:33,439 --> 00:15:35,407
Not exactly running
marathons here, you know.

159
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:37,409
Yeah, well, when did
your couch-shaped ass

160
00:15:37,443 --> 00:15:39,344
ever run any marathons?

161
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,181
- I'm proud of you, brother.
- Yeah, yeah. So how many cars we've got?

162
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:44,682
Enough to invade Poland.

163
00:15:44,717 --> 00:15:47,819
Came in their own G5,
just like Oprah has.

164
00:15:47,853 --> 00:15:49,821
- G5, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:52,757
Is that one where the--
Where the wings go up like that?

166
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:55,226
- I think they all do that.
- They all have that?

167
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,629
Anyway, we got two
U.S. attorneys in the house.

168
00:15:57,663 --> 00:16:00,231
Big doings.
Your name keeps coming up.

169
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,265
Yeah? Hey, give me
a hand here, would you?

170
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,467
Just-- just a little bit there.
Thanks.

171
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:08,038
I hired Peter Schuler in 1992.

172
00:16:08,072 --> 00:16:10,674
Almost single-handedly,

173
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,676
he grew up a little
restaurant division

174
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,778
into an industry leader

175
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:19,214
and a source
of great personal pride.

176
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,951
I am shocked and saddened
by his death

177
00:16:21,985 --> 00:16:28,290
and outraged by the damage his actions have
brought upon my grand-father's company.

178
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,827
Alleged actions.

179
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,964
An innocent man does not
kill himself.

180
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,900
My people and I
are here to help.

181
00:16:38,935 --> 00:16:41,002
Through your investigation
I pledge Madrigal's

182
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:43,838
full cooperation
and transparency.

183
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:48,342
I confess I have
my selfish reasons.

184
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,779
I believe Peter Schuler
was a lone anomaly.

185
00:16:51,813 --> 00:16:54,114
But if that is not the case,

186
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:55,616
I want to know it,

187
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,651
just as you do.

188
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:02,089
So when you gonna announce it?

189
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,791
I don't know.

190
00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:08,494
- As I'm walking out the door with my
big cardboard box.- You can't do that.

191
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,697
You know damn well we're
gonna throw you a big party.

192
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,566
Damn straight.
We're talking a blowout.

193
00:17:19,773 --> 00:17:22,007
Outstanding police work, Hank.

194
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,042
If only I'd listened.

195
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,813
But I guess
the damage was done.

196
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:32,450
It's not right,
them putting this on you.

197
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,811
Somebody's gonna go
under the bus.

198
00:17:38,246 --> 00:17:40,258
Ramey's a good man.

199
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,860
He'll do right by you.

200
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:47,131
Besides, this office
practically runs itself.

201
00:17:47,165 --> 00:17:50,234
Bullshit it does.

202
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,801
Sir.

203
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,342
What's with that APD thing?
The electromagnets?

204
00:17:58,376 --> 00:18:00,343
They're thinking
it's about Fring's laptop.

205
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,478
Turns out a couple of days
before it happened,

206
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,381
desk sergeant gets this phone
call from a "postal inspector"--

207
00:18:05,415 --> 00:18:06,882
Quote, unquote--

208
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,817
Wanting to know
where they keep the thing.

209
00:18:08,852 --> 00:18:11,687
And he told them?
Jesus.

210
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:13,689
Anything left of the laptop?

211
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:16,825
Do we look that lucky?

212
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,062
You know, I sneaked a peek before
APD took it out of Fring's office.

213
00:18:20,096 --> 00:18:22,064
The whole thing was encrypted.

214
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:24,533
They wouldn't have got
anything anyway, but...

215
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:30,272
So Hector Salamanca
killed Fring.

216
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,729
But who gave
Salamanca the bomb?

217
00:18:34,442 --> 00:18:36,077
Whole lot of questions

218
00:18:36,111 --> 00:18:37,845
and not much
in the way of answers.

219
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,346
Yet.

220
00:18:39,381 --> 00:18:43,484
The APD did find
some of Fring's financials.

221
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:46,139
That just might
lead to something.

222
00:18:50,424 --> 00:18:52,525
I had him out to my house.

223
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,828
Fourth of July.

224
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,030
We cooked out in the backyard.

225
00:18:57,065 --> 00:18:58,765
My son shucked the corn.

226
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,534
My daughter cut up potatoes.

227
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,236
Fring brought sea bass.

228
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,004
Every time I grill it now,

229
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,540
I make a little foil pouch,
just like he showed me.

230
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:11,243
That whole night,
we were laughing,

231
00:19:11,277 --> 00:19:15,881
telling stories, drinking wine.

232
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,918
And he's somebody else
completely.

233
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,653
Right in front of me.

234
00:19:24,523 --> 00:19:26,958
Right under my nose.

235
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:00,670
<i>Hi.</i>
<i>What can I get you?</i>

236
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:04,006
- Just tea, please. Chamomile.
- Oh, sorry, we don't have chamomile tea.

237
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,843
Then some sort of bergamot,
provided it's not Earl Grey.

238
00:20:06,877 --> 00:20:08,777
I like soy milk
instead of dairy.

239
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:11,813
We don't have soy milk
or any sort of bergamot.

240
00:20:11,848 --> 00:20:14,449
Wow. You're really running me
through my paces here.

241
00:20:14,484 --> 00:20:15,951
Uh-huh.

242
00:20:15,985 --> 00:20:18,286
Well, English breakfast,
I guess.

243
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,988
We have Lipton's.

244
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,524
That's pretty much all we have.

245
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,527
I would like a cup of
hot water, filtered,

246
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,228
if possible,
ad a single slice of lemon.

247
00:20:28,262 --> 00:20:30,230
And I'm assuming
you don't have stevia?

248
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:33,868
Never mind.
I brought my own.

249
00:20:36,437 --> 00:20:39,039
You coming to me,
or am I coming to you?

250
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,707
Face forward.

251
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,809
We'll talk like this.

252
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:46,479
I guess I'm coming to you.

253
00:20:47,615 --> 00:20:49,115
Ohh.

254
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:51,818
Mmm.

255
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,591
Take a breath, will you?

256
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:02,628
This place is safe,
no one's gonna see you here.

257
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,031
My God!

258
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:08,867
Duane, this is so--
Thank you.

259
00:21:08,902 --> 00:21:10,969
How did I not see you
sitting back there?

260
00:21:11,004 --> 00:21:12,637
So weird.

261
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,505
You want anything else, Mike?

262
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,674
No.

263
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,777
I'm good, Fran.
Thanks.

264
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,451
How about
we lose the sunglasses?

265
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:30,620
I feel like I'm talking
to Jackie Onassis here.

266
00:21:34,158 --> 00:21:36,159
There you go.

267
00:21:37,728 --> 00:21:40,463
Breathe in, breathe out.

268
00:21:40,497 --> 00:21:43,766
Drink your whatever.

269
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:55,143
Who killed Gus?

270
00:21:55,178 --> 00:21:57,746
Haven't I told you
not to worry about that?

271
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,349
Now, what do you want from me,
and why is it so important?

272
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,721
What's this?

273
00:22:06,755 --> 00:22:08,556
A list of 11 names.

274
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:10,058
Okay.

275
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:12,426
You know them all.

276
00:22:14,262 --> 00:22:15,729
I do.

277
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:18,398
Those 11 men-- and I think
you know this, Mike.

278
00:22:18,432 --> 00:22:20,567
Those 11 could sink us,
you and me both.

279
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,502
Where are we going
with this, Lydia?

280
00:22:22,536 --> 00:22:25,105
No specific.
I'm just pointing out facts.

281
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,207
These men-- your men--
yours and Gus's--

282
00:22:27,241 --> 00:22:29,476
these men were on the payroll,
very publicly.

283
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,411
They trace back to Pollos
and the laundry.

284
00:22:31,445 --> 00:22:33,746
They trace back to Madrigal, and they're
gonna get picked up by the police.

285
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,115
And when they do, when they get picked
up and threatened with prosecution,

286
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:38,317
and there's only one way out
for them, they're gonna--

287
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,920
And I'm not saying
all of them. Okay?

288
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:43,288
All it's gonna take is two
or three, or even one.

289
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:45,290
But there's always
a weak link somewhere.

290
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,659
But they're gonna talk.
At least one of them's gonna talk about you,

291
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,128
about me, and that's all
it's gonna take.

292
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:53,197
These are the 11 I know of,
but I'd love your input.

293
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:55,566
I never met your chemist,
for instance.

294
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:58,302
I'd love your input.

295
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,875
You want me to kill
every man on that list?

296
00:23:04,909 --> 00:23:07,645
Wow. That's a leap,

297
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,713
what you just, uh...

298
00:23:09,748 --> 00:23:12,082
No, I didn't say that.

299
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,987
But if you think
that'd be wise...

300
00:23:19,557 --> 00:23:22,158
You're scared, aren't you?

301
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,559
Yeah.

302
00:23:23,593 --> 00:23:25,561
You're very upset,

303
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:27,864
which I'm gonna factor
into my response here.

304
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:33,569
These are my guys,
and they are solid.

305
00:23:33,603 --> 00:23:35,871
- Understand?
- What about Chow at the warehouse?

306
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,073
Didn't one time you have
to shoot him through the hand?

307
00:23:38,107 --> 00:23:40,142
You think that didn't
stick in his memory?

308
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:42,077
What about Dennis
at the laundry?

309
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:43,578
They're sure to pick him up.

310
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:46,148
They already have.
They picked him up last night.

311
00:23:47,483 --> 00:23:49,617
My guys are solid.

312
00:23:49,652 --> 00:23:52,687
I vetted them with great care,

313
00:23:52,721 --> 00:23:54,855
and Fring made sure
they were well compensated

314
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,124
in the event
of a situation such as this.

315
00:23:57,159 --> 00:23:59,358
They're paid
to stand up to the heat,

316
00:23:59,393 --> 00:24:03,029
keep their mouths shut,
no matter what.

317
00:24:03,064 --> 00:24:05,065
And they will.

318
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:09,268
Now, I don't know what kind
of movies you've been watching,

319
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:12,138
but here in the real world,
we don't kill 11 people

320
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:14,673
as some kind of
prophylactic measure.

321
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,676
Look at me

322
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:20,212
and say you understand.

323
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:23,115
I understand.

324
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:24,950
I get it.

325
00:24:24,984 --> 00:24:27,119
So we're off
that very silly idea?

326
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,823
Good.

327
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:42,967
Drink your hot water.

328
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:57,480
- I gotta go.
- Have you had enough?

329
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,216
Yeah. I'm good.

330
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,383
Okay.

331
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:01,751
Bye-bye.

332
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:03,219
- Bye.
- Bye.

333
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:04,987
Bye, big brother.

334
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:06,822
Say bye to mom for me.

335
00:25:08,524 --> 00:25:10,893
I will.
Have a good day.

336
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,795
You, too.

337
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:28,910
- Skyler.
- Mmm...

338
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,245
Hey.

339
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:33,414
The car wash opens
in 15 minutes.

340
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,316
Mariano can open for me today.

341
00:25:40,521 --> 00:25:43,723
Hey, how about you get up, huh?

342
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,628
Come on.

343
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,798
A shower will feel good.

344
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,381
Hey, Chow.

345
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,452
How you holding up?

346
00:26:14,486 --> 00:26:16,554
Okay.

347
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:19,024
You know,
they-- they--

348
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:20,992
They talked to me.

349
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,660
You can't smoke in here, Chow.

350
00:26:44,148 --> 00:26:46,149
Thanks for coming down.

351
00:26:46,183 --> 00:26:49,152
Have a seat,
Mr. Ehrmantraut.

352
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:52,021
Am I, is that right?

353
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:54,223
Close enough.

354
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:57,625
So, once more, you're waiving your
right to have an attorney present?

355
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,127
Correct.

356
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:01,230
Could you state that
to the camera, please?

357
00:27:01,264 --> 00:27:04,299
I'm waiving my right
to have an attorney present.

358
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:07,802
Uh, okay, then.
We just have a few questions.

359
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:11,239
You're currently employed
by the Pollos Hermanos chain.

360
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:12,907
- Is that correct?
- Yes, I am.

361
00:27:12,941 --> 00:27:15,042
- And what do you do there?
- Corporate security.

362
00:27:15,077 --> 00:27:17,311
- Corporate security?
- Yeah.

363
00:27:17,346 --> 00:27:21,048
What's that?
Like, uh, guarding the special sauce?

364
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,751
I conduct employee
background checks,

365
00:27:23,785 --> 00:27:26,219
I oversee loss prevention.

366
00:27:26,254 --> 00:27:29,890
At a fast-food restaurant,
that's a full-time job?

367
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:33,226
We have 14 locations.
So, yes, it's a full-time job.

368
00:27:33,261 --> 00:27:34,895
Yeah, well...

369
00:27:34,929 --> 00:27:37,630
If I were you, I'd start
sending out those resumes.

370
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:40,533
It says here you're
a private investigator?

371
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,167
Where you licensed?

372
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,936
New Mexico, Arizona, Utah.

373
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,637
Every state where we operate.

374
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:47,239
Colorado?

375
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,908
You have some restaurants
there, right?

376
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:50,776
Colorado doesn't
require licensure.

377
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,644
You licensed
to carry a firearm?

378
00:27:52,678 --> 00:27:54,579
Concealed carry?
Yes, I am.

379
00:27:54,614 --> 00:27:56,115
Which states?

380
00:27:56,149 --> 00:27:58,983
It'd be quicker to mention
the states in which I'm not.

381
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:00,985
And if we pulled your CCP's,

382
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,486
everything would be in order?

383
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:04,956
I'm guessing you've already
done that, so you tell me.

384
00:28:07,893 --> 00:28:10,228
You strike me as a former cop.

385
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:11,762
Am I right?

386
00:28:13,886 --> 00:28:15,193
Where at?

387
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:19,336
Philadelphia.

388
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,405
Philly.

389
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,407
The city of brotherly love.

390
00:28:23,441 --> 00:28:27,177
It turns out we, uh--
We know some folks there,

391
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:30,246
and they told us that your
tenure as a police officer

392
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:34,183
ended somewhat,
uh, dramatically?

393
00:28:34,217 --> 00:28:36,118
You wanna talk about that?

394
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:37,686
Not particularly.

395
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,122
Yeah, me neither.

396
00:28:41,724 --> 00:28:43,792
See, I'm more interested
in why Gus Fring

397
00:28:43,827 --> 00:28:45,928
decided to put a guy like you

398
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:48,163
in charge of
his corporate security.

399
00:28:48,197 --> 00:28:52,600
I mean,
given your... history

400
00:28:52,634 --> 00:28:56,004
doing background checks
on pimple-faced fry cooks.

401
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:57,005
Seems like over...

402
00:28:57,974 --> 00:29:00,308
What else you do for Fring?

403
00:29:00,343 --> 00:29:02,977
He must've needed help
running that drug empire

404
00:29:03,011 --> 00:29:04,811
of his, no?

405
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,481
Drug empire?

406
00:29:07,515 --> 00:29:12,186
First I'm hearing about that.
I don't know anything about that.

407
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,989
Hey, man, we have a guy that could
put you in that underground lab,

408
00:29:15,023 --> 00:29:16,556
and he'll testify to it.

409
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:19,725
So from here on out,
this can go hard or easy,

410
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:22,295
so what's it gonna be?

411
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,539
Forget your handcuffs?

412
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:35,907
I'm confused.

413
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:38,343
Am I under arrest here,
or am I not?

414
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:47,419
You wanna state that
for the camera?

415
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:55,826
You are not under arrest,
currently.

416
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,362
Agents, do you have
any more questions for me?

417
00:29:58,397 --> 00:30:01,432
Because you've got me
very stirred up

418
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,767
with all these false accusations.

419
00:30:03,801 --> 00:30:06,237
If I'm not under arrest,
I'd prefer to leave.

420
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,973
Uh-uh.

421
00:30:13,277 --> 00:30:16,780
And I suppose we could talk
about the two million dollars

422
00:30:16,814 --> 00:30:19,550
in your granddaughter's name.

423
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:24,654
Yeah. It seems, uh,

424
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:27,189
Fring had all these
secret offshore accounts

425
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:28,858
that he would
deposit money into--

426
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:30,526
Like, uh, well,
an even dozen of them--

427
00:30:30,561 --> 00:30:31,994
And they're all in the names

428
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:33,529
of certain people
on his payroll.

429
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,699
There was the, uh--
The manager of the laundry,

430
00:30:36,733 --> 00:30:40,769
um, a couple guys from
the Pollos distribution center.

431
00:30:40,803 --> 00:30:44,639
There was the owner of a chemical
warehouse, a bunch of others.

432
00:30:44,674 --> 00:30:48,409
You know, guys that must've been
getting paid off the books.

433
00:30:48,444 --> 00:30:54,182
Anyway, one of the names
was Kaylee Ehrmantraut.

434
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:57,785
Ten years old

435
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,387
and just cute as a button.

436
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:02,556
Yeah.
Two million and change

437
00:31:02,591 --> 00:31:04,692
we found on deposit for her.

438
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,560
Way more than anybody else.

439
00:31:06,595 --> 00:31:08,562
Now, my partner here,

440
00:31:08,597 --> 00:31:10,897
he took one look at that
and said, "Shit, man.

441
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:14,233
This fifth-grade girl is the muscle
behind Fring's entire operation."

442
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,803
I said, "Whoa, whoa.
Hey, partner, slow down there.

443
00:31:16,837 --> 00:31:18,838
Maybe it was actually

444
00:31:18,872 --> 00:31:21,808
her dear old granddaddy."

445
00:31:21,842 --> 00:31:24,143
Impressive, no?

446
00:31:24,177 --> 00:31:25,878
But...

447
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:27,579
Level of insight?

448
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:30,983
He's not impressed, Gomie.

449
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:34,720
Perhaps he's picturing
all that money going bye-bye.

450
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,722
Yeah, well, I mean,

451
00:31:36,756 --> 00:31:40,826
the government's gonna take
every last dollar, unless...

452
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,795
Well, here's the thing, Mike--
or Michael?

453
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,064
- Mr. Ehrmantraut.
- Here's the thing, Mike.

454
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:48,899
Lucky for you,
you didn't touch that money.

455
00:31:48,934 --> 00:31:52,069
I cannot say the same
for the other 11 on the list.

456
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:54,304
One of your guys
is gonna roll on you,

457
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:56,807
and then we'll definitely
remember the handcuffs.

458
00:31:56,842 --> 00:31:58,842
Now, before that day comes,

459
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,778
you can do yourself a solid.

460
00:32:01,812 --> 00:32:04,748
You can tell us what you know,

461
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:08,417
you can tell us
who's still out there,

462
00:32:08,452 --> 00:32:11,354
and if we like your story,

463
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,356
good things can happen.

464
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,691
Kaylee might be able
to keep some of that money.

465
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,093
Maybe.

466
00:32:18,128 --> 00:32:20,295
So what do you say?

467
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:27,502
I don't know anything
about any money.

468
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,472
I don't know
what you're talking about.

469
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,134
First order of business

470
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:46,303
is to find a new place to cook.

471
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:49,671
Before anyone says it,
no more RV's.

472
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:52,674
I don't know. The crystal
ship did pretty good for us.

473
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,477
The "crystal ship"?

474
00:32:54,511 --> 00:33:00,116
- Yeah. That's what I called it. - Well,
I'll admit it held us on as a starter lab,

475
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,518
but it was too dark, too small,

476
00:33:02,552 --> 00:33:04,520
not to mention
it could've broken down

477
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:06,021
at any moment.

478
00:33:06,055 --> 00:33:09,224
Saul, find us someplace
safe from prying eyes.

479
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:11,692
Security against detection
is paramount.

480
00:33:11,727 --> 00:33:13,361
But I don't
wanna drive too far.

481
00:33:13,396 --> 00:33:16,464
No more 50-mile treks
to some Indian reservation.

482
00:33:16,499 --> 00:33:17,965
In town is trickier.

483
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,468
I mean, you got a lot more
of your prying eyes.

484
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:24,799
If Gus can manage it,
then so can we.

485
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:30,477
Precursor.
Where are we with that?

486
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:33,847
Uh, we're good on everything

487
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:37,483
except, uh, methylamine.

488
00:33:37,518 --> 00:33:39,185
No surprise.

489
00:33:39,219 --> 00:33:41,187
It's just dry as hell out there.

490
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:43,856
What if we switched back
to a pseudo cook?

491
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,691
Absolutely out of the question.

492
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,861
Jesse, there is methylamine out there.
I know it.

493
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,530
Yeah, but what if there's not?

494
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:54,199
Because there isn't.
I mean, really.

495
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,068
There is.

496
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,870
Have faith.

497
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,905
Can I--
Can I offer a thought?

498
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,240
Uh...

499
00:34:03,276 --> 00:34:05,410
Say a guy wins the lottery.

500
00:34:05,445 --> 00:34:07,345
Ten million bucks.

501
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,481
The very next day,
what's the one thing he does not do?

502
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:13,150
He does not go buy another
lottery ticket, right?

503
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:17,188
He counts his lucky stars, and
he sails off into the sunset,

504
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:20,324
which, seems to me,
and all due respect,

505
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,694
some advice you two might take.

506
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,063
What lottery did I win exactly?

507
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,731
Hey, you're alive.

508
00:34:28,765 --> 00:34:31,701
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,
that's the Irish sweepstakes.

509
00:34:31,735 --> 00:34:33,970
I'm alive, and I'm broke.

510
00:34:34,004 --> 00:34:35,972
Counting the money
that I owe Jesse,

511
00:34:36,006 --> 00:34:37,773
I'm about 40 grand in the hole.

512
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,609
Does that seem like
an acceptable

513
00:34:39,643 --> 00:34:41,677
stopping point to you?

514
00:34:43,647 --> 00:34:46,548
There is gold in the streets,

515
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:51,954
just waiting for someone to come and
scoop it up. But, me? I should quit now.

516
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,423
Jesse, too, I suppose, huh?

517
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:55,992
Wow.

518
00:34:56,026 --> 00:34:59,160
I got you this time, kid.

519
00:34:59,194 --> 00:35:01,830
And how come you get two,
and I only get one?

520
00:35:01,864 --> 00:35:04,633
Hmm?

521
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:06,300
Oh, no, you don't.

522
00:35:06,335 --> 00:35:08,670
That one's mine!

523
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:12,974
No. Aaahhh!

524
00:35:19,114 --> 00:35:20,948
Oh.

525
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:24,885
I give up, baby.

526
00:35:26,688 --> 00:35:28,689
You're too good.

527
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:34,160
- Yeah?
<i>It's me, you got a minute?</i>

528
00:35:34,194 --> 00:35:36,796
<i>Yeah. A minute.</i>
<i>What's up, Chow?</i>

529
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:40,099
The DEA,
they call me to come back.

530
00:35:40,134 --> 00:35:43,169
- Say they want to talk more.
<i>- I'm sure they do.</i>

531
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:45,104
Did you call your lawyer?

532
00:35:45,139 --> 00:35:48,173
<i>Yeah, but, Mike,</i>
<i>the DEA take all my money.</i>

533
00:35:48,207 --> 00:35:49,507
<i>I need it.</i>

534
00:35:49,542 --> 00:35:51,509
I need my money.

535
00:35:51,544 --> 00:35:53,511
You understand.

536
00:35:53,546 --> 00:35:56,114
<i>What do you want me</i>
<i>to do about it?</i>

537
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:57,949
I don't know.

538
00:35:57,984 --> 00:36:00,686
I don't know.
We gotta talk.

539
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,519
Not on the phone.

540
00:36:02,554 --> 00:36:04,655
<i>Can you come to my house?</i>

541
00:36:08,526 --> 00:36:09,994
All right.

542
00:36:10,028 --> 00:36:11,996
<i>Give me two hours.</i>

543
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,879
Chris.

544
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:45,917
I'd like you to drop your gun
where you stand,

545
00:37:45,951 --> 00:37:49,287
and then turn around
very slowly.

546
00:38:04,502 --> 00:38:07,505
Come on over
and sit next to Chow.

547
00:38:29,425 --> 00:38:32,093
How much was she gonna pay you?

548
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:36,464
Ten thousand a name.

549
00:38:38,434 --> 00:38:41,502
How far did you get
down the list?

550
00:38:41,537 --> 00:38:43,070
Just Chow.

551
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:45,105
I figured I'd start with you.

552
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,442
For you,
she was gonna pay 30,000.

553
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:52,143
I'm very sorry about this, Mike.

554
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,381
But I needed the money.

555
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,417
Those feds,
they took it all, man.

556
00:39:00,988 --> 00:39:02,655
I know.

557
00:39:03,956 --> 00:39:05,771
Are you ready?

558
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:07,693
Listen, Mike...

559
00:39:29,195 --> 00:39:31,996
Kira, come and
have some cookies.

560
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,665
It's a cookie!

561
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,866
It's a cookie, yes!

562
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:38,035
Let's go. Uh-huh.

563
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,771
Vamos a contar.
Let's count.

564
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:45,242
<i>Uno. Dos. Tres.</i>

565
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:46,844
<i>- Cuatro.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

566
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:48,212
<i>Cinco.</i>

567
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:50,547
<i>- Seis.</i>
<i>- Seis. Muy bien.</i>

568
00:39:50,582 --> 00:39:52,349
<i>- Siete.</i>
<i>- Siete.</i>

569
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:53,883
<i>Ocho.</i>

570
00:39:53,918 --> 00:39:56,986
<i>Nueve. Diez.</i>

571
00:39:57,021 --> 00:40:00,724
<i>Muy bien.
Ahora los colores, a ver.</i>

572
00:40:00,758 --> 00:40:03,492
<i>- Amarillo.</i>
<i>- Amarillo.</i>

573
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:06,062
<i>- Rosado.</i>
<i>- Rosado.</i>

574
00:40:06,097 --> 00:40:08,264
<i>- Azul.</i>
<i>- Azul.</i>

575
00:40:08,298 --> 00:40:10,365
<i>- Verde.</i>
<i>- Verde.</i>

576
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:12,701
- Marron. - Marron.

577
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:14,937
Anaranjado.

578
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,105
Anaranjado.

579
00:40:16,139 --> 00:40:18,473
Well, look at this.
What are you doing?

580
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:20,943
- Hey, mommy!
- What are you doing still up?

581
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,911
Hey, yourself.
Give me a kiss.

582
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:24,579
She said she wanted
to wait for you.

583
00:40:24,614 --> 00:40:26,247
She does, huh?

584
00:40:26,281 --> 00:40:28,883
Well, who's the adult
here, Delores?

585
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,885
Tell me she ate
her dinner, at least.

586
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:32,787
Oh, yes, she ate everything.

587
00:40:32,821 --> 00:40:33,788
She ate her peas,
she ate her carrots.

588
00:40:33,822 --> 00:40:34,789
Do whatever it takes

589
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:36,224
to keep them out of here,
or they die.

590
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:38,960
- Understand?
- She ate a whole lot of carrots this time.

591
00:40:38,994 --> 00:40:41,694
- Yep.
- That's right, my girl.

592
00:40:43,097 --> 00:40:45,232
Delores, I'm gonna take a bath.

593
00:40:45,266 --> 00:40:48,235
Put Kira to bed and then go on home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

594
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:50,403
Really? You don't want
me to wait for you?

595
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:52,939
- No, you go home.
- Thank you.

596
00:40:52,974 --> 00:40:54,607
<i>Si,</i> Ms. Lydia.

597
00:40:54,642 --> 00:40:56,509
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

598
00:40:56,543 --> 00:41:00,445
Mommy, you gonna come
say good night to me?

599
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,982
Yeah, honey.
After mommy takes a bath.

600
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:04,616
Okay.

601
00:41:05,618 --> 00:41:07,953
Love you.

602
00:41:07,988 --> 00:41:11,490
Mommy's very
tired, so let's go to bed.

603
00:41:28,174 --> 00:41:31,108
I won't have to
unless you scream.

604
00:41:31,142 --> 00:41:33,476
You know why I'm here?

605
00:41:36,247 --> 00:41:38,515
What are you waiting for?

606
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:40,650
The nanny to leave.

607
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:43,653
If you have anything
to say to me,

608
00:41:43,688 --> 00:41:45,855
now's the time.

609
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:55,698
Two good men died
because of you.

610
00:41:58,468 --> 00:42:00,502
Don't shoot me in the face.

611
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:01,837
Please.

612
00:42:01,871 --> 00:42:03,939
I don't want my daughter
seeing me like that.

613
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:06,474
- Your daughter won't see you.
- Yes, she will. She'll find me.

614
00:42:06,508 --> 00:42:08,476
She never once sleeps
through the night.

615
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,312
Nobody's gonna find you, Lydia.

616
00:42:11,347 --> 00:42:13,315
Wait. What?

617
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:15,083
No.

618
00:42:15,117 --> 00:42:16,884
No. No.

619
00:42:16,918 --> 00:42:19,286
No! Sh-she
has to find me.

620
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,688
- Lower your voice.
- She has to find me.

621
00:42:21,723 --> 00:42:23,457
She has to find me.
I-- I--

622
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,692
You want your
five-year-old daughter

623
00:42:25,727 --> 00:42:27,694
stumbling across
your dead body?

624
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:30,797
I can't just disappear.
She has to know I didn't leave her.

625
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:33,032
- She has to know that!
- Keep your voice down.

626
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,968
I don't care what you do.

627
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:36,936
I'll scream and
I'll keep screaming.

628
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,604
My daughter's not thinking
I abandoned her!

629
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:41,875
Shut up and calm down.

630
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,776
I don't care.
You have to promise.

631
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,845
You have to promise me...

632
00:42:54,287 --> 00:42:57,689
Promise I don't disappear.

633
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:25,581
Can you still get
your hands on methylamine?

634
00:43:29,586 --> 00:43:31,554
Methylamine, Lydia.

635
00:43:31,588 --> 00:43:33,957
Can you still get it?

636
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:37,126
Maybe.

637
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:40,495
Why?

638
00:43:55,377 --> 00:43:56,610
Aww...

639
00:44:04,253 --> 00:44:05,619
Yes?

640
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:09,089
<i>You still plan to move forward?</i>

641
00:44:09,123 --> 00:44:10,790
Yes, we do.

642
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:15,462
I've reconsidered.
I'm in.

643
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:19,099
Good.

644
00:44:37,851 --> 00:44:41,319
Well, you missed a good meal.

645
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:43,989
The lasagna came out very well,

646
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:46,124
if I do say so myself.

647
00:44:48,794 --> 00:44:52,230
I wrapped some up for you
if you'd like some later.

648
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:11,515
You know, it gets easier.

649
00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:13,949
I promise you that it does.

650
00:45:17,021 --> 00:45:19,188
What you're feeling
right now...

651
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:23,926
About, uh, Ted...

652
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:27,296
Everything...

653
00:45:30,366 --> 00:45:32,300
It'll pass.

654
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:26,651
When we do...

655
00:46:27,687 --> 00:46:30,521
what we do for good reasons...

656
00:46:35,995 --> 00:46:38,529
then we've got
nothing to worry about.

657
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:46,403
And there's no better reason...

658
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,074
than family.

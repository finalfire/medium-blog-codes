1
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,277
These people.

2
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,795
Pathetic.

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,796
I already read that one anyway.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,877
Kleinman has better magazines.

5
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,152
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,669
We won't even get the results
till next week.

7
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,348
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,154
It is a full PET<i>I</i>CT, correct?

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,273
You definitely want the PET<i>I</i>CT
and not just the PET.

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,790
Yeah, it's a PET<i>I</i>CT.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,355
Good. That's what you want.

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,757
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,675
I'm not naming any names.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,758
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,552
This is where Walt's doctor is.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,320
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

17
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,192
...to get the results.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,233
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,953
I could take one look at Walt's...

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,396
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,273
-Really.
-Doctors like people to think...

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,790
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,959
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

24
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,159
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,318
Excuse me.

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,918
You all right in there?

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,833
Yeah.

28
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,998
Hey, you okay?

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,633
Yes.

30
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,876
I'm fine, thank you.

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,118
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,155
-So how'd we do?
-You did fine.

33
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,278
-See anything?
-I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

34
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,199
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,753
Sorry.

36
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,876
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,516
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

38
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

39
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,268
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,391
How much time they giving you?

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,833
Weeks.

42
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,553
Maybe.

43
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,159
Sorry to hear it.

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,830
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

45
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,715
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,514
How much money
are we laundering?

47
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,678
At this time, $16,000.

48
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,953
How long you been doing this?

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,309
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

50
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,919
Yeah, apparently.

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,240
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

52
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,830
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,077
...comes to $9960.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,750
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

55
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,350
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

56
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,835
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

57
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,157
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

58
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,077
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,431
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

60
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,951
Actually, I....

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,393
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

62
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,271
-Really?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,758
You know, I never did call her.

64
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,636
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

65
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,118
God, Walt.

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,037
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,471
I am. Positive is good.

68
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,829
I'm all for positive...

69
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,318
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

70
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,839
It....

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,788
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,319
I know.

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,751
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

74
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,951
You know, forgive me.

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,113
Look...

76
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,118
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if--

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,833
If...

78
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,948
...I'm no longer around.

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,232
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,509
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

81
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,430
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

82
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,199
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,757
A 30-minute discourse...

84
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,270
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,631
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

86
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,871
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

87
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,915
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

88
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,278
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

89
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,439
Yeah.

90
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,959
-We should do something.
-Yeah, we should.

91
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,515
No, something else.

92
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,391
We should go somewhere.

93
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,271
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

94
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,516
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

95
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,076
Georgia O'Keeffe.

96
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,111
She's a painter.

97
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,591
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

98
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,597
No, is that bad?

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,351
-Boy, you need some educating.
-Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

100
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,552
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,196
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

102
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,868
So romantic.

103
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,640
Yup, we're going. Get up.

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,473
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,875
It's the shit.

106
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,077
A little culture won't kill you.

107
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,716
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.

108
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,115
Really?

109
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,188
-Is there still cereal?
-Yeah.

110
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,913
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

111
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,759
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>
<i>Pick up the phone.</i>

112
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,032
<i>-Hello? Jesse, pick up--</i>
-Hold on, hold on.

113
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,196
Sorry, one sec.

114
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,628
-What?
<i>-I've been trying to reach you.</i>

115
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,955
Where's your drop phone?

116
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,554
-I've been busy.
<i>-Well, clear your social calendar.</i>

117
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,150
-We have to cook.
<i>-What? Today?</i>

118
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,669
<i>No, you'll need today at least</i>
<i>to gather supplies.</i>

119
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,030
<i>Now, we're going to need</i>
<i>all new glassware...</i>

120
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,629
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

121
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,593
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

122
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,633
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

123
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,479
<i>Smoking marijuana,</i>
<i>eating Cheetos and masturbating...</i>

124
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,069
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

125
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,271
<i>Well, screw you and your book, man,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

126
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,313
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

127
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,559
-You're going to a museum, huh?
-Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

128
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,672
-Georgia O'Keeffe?
<i>-She's a painter, duh.</i>

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,279
She does these vagina pictures.

130
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,472
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

131
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,033
What are you even talking about?

132
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,277
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

133
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,471
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,877
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,479
Let me explain something to you.

136
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,592
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

137
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,839
-Tuesday? Four days straight?
-Like it or not, we have no choice.

138
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,191
<i>Yeah? And why exactly is that?</i>

139
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,196
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

140
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,550
-What?
-<i>It's losing its chemical potency.</i>

141
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,752
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you....

142
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,188
<i>Hell, no.</i>

143
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,914
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

144
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,236
<i>You have a paper and pencil?</i>

145
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,309
<i>-Come on.</i>
-All right, all right. Go.

146
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,274
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

147
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,596
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,756
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

149
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,272
Me too.

150
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,152
But I'll be back before you know it...

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,954
...and you can always call
if you need me.

152
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,551
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

153
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,993
Love you.

154
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,640
-Fly safe, okay?
-Okay.

155
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,108
<i>The white zone is for immediate</i>
<i>loading and unloading...</i>

156
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,639
<i>...of passengers only.</i>

157
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,637
<i>No parking.</i>

158
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,558
<i>Attention, passengers.:</i>
<i>Please maintain visual contact...</i>

159
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,990
<i>...with your personal belongings</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

160
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,509
<i>Any bags left unattended</i>
<i>will be confiscated...</i>

161
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,597
<i>...by airport personnel.</i>

162
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,754
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

163
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,474
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,750
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

165
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,190
-Yeah.
-With reflux condensers?

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,913
Yes. Like I said, yes.

167
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,591
-Just go. Drive. Go, go.
-Okay.

168
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,679
Good morning to you too, man.

169
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,031
-Stupid--
-Three entire bags of Funyuns?

170
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,470
What? Funyuns are awesome.

171
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,636
-God.
-Hey, more for me.

172
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,593
How about something
with some protein maybe?

173
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,995
Something green, huh?

174
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,432
Man, I'm getting no service.

175
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,915
How are you even alive?

176
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,355
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

177
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,198
Yeah, I've got a signal.

178
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,669
-Hey, let me use yours, would you?
-Absolutely not.

179
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,950
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

180
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,116
-You know that.
-It's not business, all right?

181
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,548
-It's personal.
-Oh, personal.

182
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:33,433
-What, female?
-Maybe.

183
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,392
Absolutely. That's all I need.

184
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,795
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

185
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,549
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

186
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,429
Sorry. My wife checks.

187
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,432
-Drinking water?
-Yup.

188
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,232
Is that all we've got?

189
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,194
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

190
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,068
Oh, God.

191
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,515
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

192
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,871
-Oh, our "workstation."
-That's right.

193
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,116
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

194
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,799
Considering it's our only set...

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,833
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

196
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,637
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

197
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,630
Two-point-three-five pounds.

198
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,479
Two-point-three-five.

199
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,272
That's the last of it.

200
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,030
-How many total?
-Nineteen.

201
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,120
So dollar-wise?

202
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,878
How much?

203
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,072
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

204
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,831
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at....

205
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,315
-What are we selling for these days?
-Forty a pound.

206
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,193
-Forty thousand dollars?
-Hey, you said raise the prices.

207
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,153
All right, that's 40 times 42...

208
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,272
...minus distribution charges....

209
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,555
What?

210
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,348
What?

211
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,310
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

212
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,034
-All in?
-No.

213
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,759
Each.

214
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,315
Each?

215
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,035
-Each.
-Six hundred and--?

216
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,595
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

217
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,110
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

218
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,836
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

219
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,718
Yes! Yes!

220
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,318
Well, there goes the generator.

221
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,750
I think that's it for the gas.

222
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,393
Perfect timing, yo.

223
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,353
-How do you figure that?
-What do you mean?

224
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,515
We're done cooking.

225
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,518
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

226
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,835
Look at this.

227
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,157
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

228
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,352
-Come on, where's your ambition?
-Jesus. Seriously?

229
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,755
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

230
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,793
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,798
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,468
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

233
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,114
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

234
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,754
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

235
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,393
...and glass up the rest.

236
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,555
Come on.

237
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,513
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

238
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,312
Grand Slam?

239
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,590
Hot shower?

240
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,869
A bed?

241
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,234
-Separate rooms.
-Yeah, that's a given.

242
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,632
What the hell?

243
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,238
What the...? The battery's dead.

244
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,713
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

245
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,474
...where did you put them?

246
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,231
-I left them right here in the ignition.
-Son of a bitch.

247
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,510
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

248
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,199
-The buzzer didn't buzz.
-The what?

249
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,550
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

250
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,318
...to let you know the battery's on.

251
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,112
I know that. It didn't buzz.

252
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,515
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

253
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,518
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

254
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,756
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

255
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,474
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

256
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,194
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

257
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,435
The buzzer did not buzz.

258
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,710
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

259
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,478
Yes, I see your point.

260
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,194
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

261
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,472
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

262
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,194
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

263
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,675
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

264
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,711
-Jesus.
-Okay, just....

265
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,519
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

266
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,278
Okay.

267
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,629
How?

268
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,550
You gonna be okay?

269
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,837
Oh, damn it.

270
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,078
What's it taste like?

271
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,669
Bad, huh?

272
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,796
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

273
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,912
Okay. There.

274
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,714
Here. Red to red, black to black.

275
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,950
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

276
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,590
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

277
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,598
-You have to really pull.
-I am.

278
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,518
No, really pull, not like a girl.

279
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,280
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

280
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,798
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

281
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,149
Oh, my God.

282
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,352
Oh, jeez.

283
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,195
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just....

284
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,913
Well done.

285
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,919
God.

286
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,876
Come on, you bitches.

287
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,071
Hear me now.

288
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,511
Damn it.

289
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,992
Stupid.

290
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,070
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

291
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,316
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

292
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,438
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

293
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,279
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

294
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,549
How do you know?

295
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,991
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

296
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,872
-That's what I know.
-There was a fire.

297
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,832
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

298
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,031
Is that what you were--?
You were thinking?

299
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,992
Now that we have
identified the problem--

300
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,316
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

301
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,355
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

302
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,710
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

303
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,436
Mr. White, come on.

304
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,035
God.

305
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,109
All right, look, just make it snappy.

306
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,278
-Roaming drains the battery.
-All right.

307
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,072
Yo, Skinny, hey.

308
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,317
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

309
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,798
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

310
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,752
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

311
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,315
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

312
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,794
All right, so you ready?

313
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,913
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

314
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,557
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

315
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,512
All right--
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

316
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,836
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

317
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,157
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

318
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,113
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

319
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,959
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

320
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:47,233
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

321
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,158
About another 15 miles.

322
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,999
-Really? That far?
-Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

323
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,158
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

324
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,909
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

325
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,476
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

326
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,238
Leave now.

327
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,199
Here.

328
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,958
He's coming.

329
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,435
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

330
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,949
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

331
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,720
...and he had to drink urine for....

332
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,673
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

333
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,750
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

334
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,432
Look, we should just call, you know?

335
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,269
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

336
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,959
All right.

337
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,598
Come on.

338
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,595
Yo. Yo, where are you?

339
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,993
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

340
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,634
Yes, he's almost here.

341
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,469
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

342
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,035
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

343
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,151
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

344
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,318
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

345
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,511
Wait, wait. What river?

346
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,993
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

347
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,634
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

348
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,956
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?

349
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,713
Phone's dead.

350
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,992
Now what?

351
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,792
Mr. White, what now?

352
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,431
Oh, come on. Seriously?

353
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,272
What's this?

354
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,391
I'm trying to...

355
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,229
...trickle-charge the battery.

356
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,917
Seriously?

357
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,276
Just by turning that thing?

358
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,198
The commutator.

359
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,235
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

360
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,189
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

361
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,312
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled....

362
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,392
Anyway.

363
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,230
Apply a little elbow grease.

364
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,639
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

365
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,594
...but theoretically...

366
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,591
...it should work.

367
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,951
Theoretically.

368
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,398
It has to work.

369
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,992
You understand?

370
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,918
Can I try?

371
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,919
Yeah.

372
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,352
How much longer?

373
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,032
I don't know.

374
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,432
Now?

375
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,198
Hey.

376
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,718
Mr. White.

377
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,839
Hey.

378
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,599
Yeah?

379
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,990
Yo, man, you hanging in?

380
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,597
Yeah, I'm good.

381
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,230
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

382
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,548
No, give it a little longer...

383
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,751
...just to make sure we're--

384
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,200
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

385
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,799
...does it?

386
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,309
No. That's not why we're here.

387
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,319
Yo.

388
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,279
Lie much?

389
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,593
Here, push.

390
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,398
Okay, okay, okay.

391
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,153
Now.

392
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,153
Go on.

393
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,393
Please, please, please.

394
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,469
Yes. Yes.

395
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,996
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

396
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,589
No. God.

397
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,512
Please. Please.

398
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,031
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

399
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,073
Why? Why?

400
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,471
Mr. White.

401
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,238
Mr. White!

402
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,072
What are you doing?

403
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,278
Mr. White?

404
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,351
Oh, God.

405
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,156
I have this coming.

406
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,039
What?

407
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,636
I have it coming.

408
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,591
I deserve this.

409
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,917
Hey, snap out of it.

410
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,908
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

411
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,553
Right?

412
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,199
All I ever managed to do...

413
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,597
...was worry and disappoint them...

414
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,032
...and lie.

415
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,709
Oh, God.

416
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,716
All the lies.

417
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,278
I can't even....

418
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,358
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

419
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,080
You know what? Screw this.

420
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,716
I'm walking. You can come or not.

421
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,034
Where's my other shoe?

422
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,318
Jesse. Jesse.

423
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,151
Your body...

424
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:18,035
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

425
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,110
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

426
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,675
And when they're gone...

427
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,510
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

428
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,558
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

429
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,594
You go marching out there...

430
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,509
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

431
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:47,633
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

432
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,671
...and think of something scientific.

433
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,997
Something--
Something scientific, right.

434
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,033
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

435
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,800
You made poison out of beans, yo.

436
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,109
All right, look. We got--

437
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,235
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

438
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,396
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

439
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,068
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

440
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,078
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

441
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,431
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

442
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,234
...or a homing device...

443
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,192
...or build a new battery or....

444
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,152
Or wait, no.

445
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,510
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

446
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,030
...and build it into something
completely different?

447
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,993
You know, like a....
Like a dune buggy.

448
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,510
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or....

449
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,478
What? Hey. What is it?

450
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,913
What?

451
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,553
Do you have any money?

452
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,829
Change, I mean. Coins.

453
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,713
-Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
-Okay.

454
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,672
-Yes.
-Gather them.

455
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,589
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

456
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,031
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

457
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,676
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

458
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,996
-Solid zinc, okay.
-And-- And bring me--

459
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,475
Bring me brake pads.

460
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,116
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

461
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,959
-Okay. Brake pads, okay.
-Brake pads.

462
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,315
What are we building?

463
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,913
-You said it yourself.
-A robot?

464
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,159
-A battery.
-Yes.

465
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,157
Move!

466
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,959
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

467
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,230
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

468
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,032
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

469
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,994
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

470
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,792
Remember the electrolytes?

471
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,235
Well, think about it.

472
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,951
A battery is a galvanic cell.

473
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,799
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

474
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,036
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

475
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,717
-Right.
-Yeah, well, anyway.

476
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,390
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

477
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,716
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

478
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,913
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

479
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,193
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

480
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,916
Then.... Here, I'll show you.

481
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,554
On the opposite side is our anode.

482
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,513
This.

483
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,359
It's zinc.

484
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:40,429
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

485
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,916
-So the sponge is the electrolyte?
-Yeah.

486
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,829
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

487
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:51,953
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

488
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,319
Good.

489
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:59,870
Good. And now, what shall we use...

490
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,640
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

491
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:07,955
What one particular element
comes to mind?

492
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,317
Wire.

493
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,833
Copper.

494
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,996
-Oh, I mean--
-Copper.

495
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,553
Right.

496
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:27,432
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

497
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,438
And how many cells will we need?

498
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,393
We've only got material enough
for six.

499
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,192
Okay.

500
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,992
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

501
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,599
All right.

502
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,398
Cathode.

503
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,833
Anode.

504
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,918
Damn. That is good.

505
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,271
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

506
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,395
Come on.

507
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,152
<i>Attention, passengers.:</i>
<i>Please maintain visual contact...</i>

508
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,555
<i>...with your personal belongings</i>
<i>at all times.</i>

509
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,149
<i>Any bags left unattended</i>
<i>will be confiscated by....</i>

510
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,032
How's the...?

511
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,633
It's fine.

512
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,352
I know I can trust you to....

513
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,558
Yeah.

514
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,993
Hey, whatever happens...

515
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,749
...your family will get your share.

516
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,993
Thank you.

517
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,158
So...

518
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,876
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

519
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,993
Yeah.

520
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,837
<i>How's everyone doing?</i>

521
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,519
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

522
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,554
-I know. I know, enough already. It's--
-I'm teasing.

523
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,637
Everything in its time.

524
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,914
Walt, I have your scan results.

525
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,630
-Yeah.
-You're showing signs of remission.

526
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,588
-Oh, my God.
-I wanna clarify.

527
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,394
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

528
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,875
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

529
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,038
To classify someone
as in remission...

530
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,834
...we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

531
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,315
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

532
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,989
Technically speaking...

533
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,112
...a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before...

534
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,675
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

535
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,270
Now, in Walt's case,
with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...

536
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,391
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

537
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,070
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass...

538
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,559
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

539
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,478
Everybody still with me?

540
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,430
And how has my cancer responded?

541
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,871
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

542
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,312
-Oh, my God.
-Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

543
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,670
Wait, I'm really.... I'm confused.

544
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,189
Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

545
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,233
-Mom, yeah.
-Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

546
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,435
-Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
-Sweetheart, you were right.

547
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,279
-It's very good news.
-It's very good news.

548
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,392
-Oh, my God.
-My God, are you kidding me?

549
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,639
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

550
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,632
That's great.

551
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,312
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

552
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,229
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

553
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,432
It's okay. This is fairly common.

554
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,918
See that scary-looking thing there?

555
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,797
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

556
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,113
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

557
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,311
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

558
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,318
Tissue inflammation? I....

559
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,397
Are you sure about that? I mean, I--

560
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,152
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

561
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,238
-What?
-You probably have a tear...

562
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,953
...in your oesophagus
from coughing.

563
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,833
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

564
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,272
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

565
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,233
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

566
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,874
-I'm sorry, I just--
-No more secrets, Walt.

567
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,629
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

568
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,839
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

569
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,871
But now at least
we have some options...

570
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,833
...the most important of which
is time.

571
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,190
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

572
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,029
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

573
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,157
-Yes.
-Yeah.

574
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,475
Oh, my God.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

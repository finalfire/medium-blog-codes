1
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,359
-What's up?
-How's it going?

2
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,515
All right.

3
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,879
What you need?

4
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,236
You buying
or you just stopping to envy?

5
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,716
Yeah. Punk bitches.

6
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,679
<i>Please leave your message</i>

<i>To send a numeric page--</i>

8
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,989
Bounce, little man.

9
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,556
Skinny, I'm up on 2nd and Hazeltine,
getting eyeballed hard.

10
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,910
I got a bad feeling, man.
I need some backup.

11
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,315
Get your ass up here now.

12
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,837
-What's that thing in your ear?
-What did I say? Get out of here!

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,910
What are you waiting for? Go!

14
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,630
Well, Walt, we've made such headway
with your treatments...

15
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,912
...that now it's time we talked about
sealing the deal.

16
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,314
Absolutely.

17
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,839
As you know...

18
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,918
...my initial diagnosis was
that your cancer was inoperable.

19
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,717
That may no longer be the case.

20
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,232
We think now that a lobectomy
may be a viable option.

21
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,158
Maybe a pretty good option.

22
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Dr. Bravenec is one of
the few surgeons in the country...

23
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,588
...performing lobectomies
after full-dosage radiation.

24
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,030
He's got a good track record.

25
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,753
Pretty good.

26
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,396
It sounds...

27
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,709
...aggressive.

28
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,953
Yes. Very much so.

29
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,833
Understand that
if you don't have this surgery...

30
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,235
...you're just waiting
for the cancer to spread.

31
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,476
And it will.

32
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,192
Through the treatment you've had,
we've bought you some time.

33
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,358
Maybe a lot, probably a little...

34
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,918
...but that's all.

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,838
In my opinion...

36
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,235
...if you're willing to take some risk...

37
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,476
...then this offers the best chance.

38
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,639
How much would it cost?
I mean, I'm not on your insurance.

39
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,513
I'd say between 170-...

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,029
...and 200,000, all in.

41
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,676
For my part, I'd be willing
to write off what I can...

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,553
...but mine isn't even
the biggest expense.

43
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,996
This is obviously a big decision...

44
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,351
...and you folks are gonna wanna
take some time to discuss it.

45
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,679
No.

46
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,038
I'll do it.

47
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,590
Walt, don't you think we should
at least talk this through first?

48
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,713
I just think it's the way to go.

49
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,792
I have to say,
I think it's the right choice.

50
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,955
I recommend
that we let the pneumonitis heal...

51
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,878
...for another couple of weeks...

52
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,275
...and then we'll have at it.

53
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,596
That's tricky.

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,590
-When's the due date?
-It's the 21 st.

55
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,074
So two weeks and change?

56
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,396
I'll book the surgery
for four weeks from now.

57
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,592
That way Walter can be on his feet
for the birth of your daughter.

58
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,997
But I wouldn't wait any longer.

59
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,873
Yeah.

60
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,754
Fourteen messages....

61
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,757
God.

62
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,113
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-It's me.

63
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,596
<i>Where the hell were you?</i>
<i>I called, like, 20 times.</i>

64
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,119
Working.

65
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,594
What is it?

66
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,158
Combo's dead.

67
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,273
<i>Shot.</i>

68
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,989
Which one is he?

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,713
You did not just say that to me.

70
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,275
-<i>Jesse, listen--</i>
-That figures.

71
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,993
What's the word on the street?

72
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,716
No one's dropping no names.

73
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,957
Combo rang me before it went down,
said dudes were mad-dogging him...

74
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,789
...trying to run him up off the corner.
That's all I know.

75
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,078
Why'd we have to go pushing
into new turf, yo? I mean...

76
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,998
...what'd you expect?

77
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,434
I don't know.

78
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,232
You don't know?

79
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,152
Is that all you got?

80
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,033
I'll do right by Combo's people.

81
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,237
But make sure you bust up your cell
and toss it, all right? We'll figure it out.

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,914
I appreciate what
you're saying and all...

83
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,352
...but with Combo gone
and Badger laying low out in Cali....

84
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,719
I'm on probation, man.

85
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,673
Fast track to Los Lunas.

86
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,117
We're on the verge...

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,359
...of making some serious coin,
Skinny.

88
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,915
What, you're gonna jump ship now?

89
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,514
This game we playing? We don't got
the street cred to survive it.

90
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,355
Back when everyone thought
you killed Spooge...

91
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,313
...maybe we were doing okay,
but that whole...

92
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,673
-...thing to the head thing, the ATM?
-Yeah?

93
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,552
His junkie bitch copped to it.

94
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,595
Whole town knows it wasn't you.

95
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,833
Everyone knows?

96
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,435
-Why didn't you say something?
-I don't know, man.

97
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,039
Because we like you and all.

98
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,232
I'm telling you, just sit tight.

99
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,308
We'll get by.

100
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,149
-All right? We'll make it.
-Sorry, Jesse.

101
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,399
I'm out.

102
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,711
We have had a bit of a setback.

103
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,750
That's an accurate description.
What else do you want me to call it?

104
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,633
-How about "your fault"?
-No, no, don't lay that on me.

105
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,877
-You are in charge of distribution.
-You said expand the territory.

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,389
-Doesn't mean you become careless.
-Guys, guys! Hey!

107
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,353
Do I look like Maury Povich?
I'm not your marriage counsellor.

108
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,074
Now, you're professionals.
Act like it.

109
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,236
Now, setback. Go.

110
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,357
One of our dealers was murdered.

111
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,279
It was some kind of turf dispute...

112
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,516
...and apparently we lost.

113
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,359
And then everyone quit on us.

114
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,269
I mean,
we have absolutely no distribution.

115
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,835
Is there any way any of this
can be traced back to you?

116
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,996
Now, the police, I'm talking about.

117
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,552
Well, there's your silver lining.

118
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,433
How about you?
How's the health situation?

119
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,791
It's better. Do you mind?

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,399
Better?

121
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,637
Yeah, it's...

122
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,639
...looking a little more positive.

123
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,512
I may have more time than I thought.

124
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,472
Outstanding.

125
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,875
Now, as to your dead guy:

126
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,798
occupational hazard.

127
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,194
Drug dealer getting shot?

128
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,279
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
and say it's been known to happen.

129
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,438
Now, what about product on hand?
How's your inventory?

130
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,631
Thirty-eight and change.

131
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,637
Thirty-eight ounces? Grams?

132
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,989
Pounds.

133
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,228
You did say make hay
while the sun is shining.

134
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,431
Guys!

135
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,437
Why the long faces here?

136
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,676
You're sitting on a gold mine.

137
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,871
A gold mine we can't sell.

138
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,275
We need a proper infrastructure.

139
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,710
We need foot soldiers
and we need dealers...

140
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,672
...on a street level
that are rock solid.

141
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,838
We need muscle
and we need enforcers.

142
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,917
Payback. That's what we need.

143
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,319
God.

144
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,236
I mean, this entire process
has just been so....

145
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,991
It's always been one step forward
and two steps back.

146
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,591
We need your help.

147
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,714
Look, let's start with
some tough love, all right?

148
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,512
Ready for this? Here goes.

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,474
You two suck at peddling meth.
Period.

150
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,035
So give up on trying
to do it all yourselves.

151
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,549
Hell, I'm amazed you got this far.

152
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,992
Look, we are not going to deal with
another high-level distributor.

153
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,316
No, thank you.
We have been down that road.

154
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,034
What, some tattooed speed freak?

155
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,516
No. What you two need
is an honest-to-God businessman.

156
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,438
Somebody who treats your product...

157
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,871
...like the simple
high-margin commodity that it is.

158
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,152
Somebody who ships out of town,
deals only in bulk.

159
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,512
Someone who's been doing this
for 20 years and never been caught.

160
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,192
You know someone like that?

161
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,188
Let's just say I know a guy
who knows a guy.

162
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,197
Who knows another guy.

163
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,075
Let me make some calls,
see if I can get you a meeting.

164
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,951
Well, what's his name?

165
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,639
I have no idea.

166
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,109
He's very low profile.
He's careful like that.

167
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,310
You know,
from what I do hear about him...

168
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,431
...he sounds a little like you.

169
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,919
<i>And McDonald tabletops it, lands it.</i>

170
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,588
<i>He's coming to the end</i>
<i>and he's got the big fist pump.</i>

171
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,712
<i>Now Mueller's coming.</i>
<i>Oh, a double! Here he comes.</i>

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,310
<i>And he's coming to the end</i>
<i>and he takes second.</i>

173
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,476
I need you to leave.

174
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,996
Look, there's...

175
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,918
...some stuff about me
you don't know and....

176
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,233
Like you're a drug dealer?

177
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,439
I kind of got that.

178
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,554
You pay in cash
and you use an alias, so....

179
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,955
One of my guys...

180
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,399
...a friend who worked for me...

181
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,674
...got murdered.

182
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,630
It was my fault.
I put him on that corner.

183
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,314
I'm gonna smoke some crystal
and I just think you should go...

184
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,399
...being that you're in a programme
and all and....

185
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,237
You could come with me
to a meeting.

186
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,713
No.

187
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,319
No meetings.

188
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,589
We could just get out of here.

189
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,998
-It won't help.
-Yeah, it will.

190
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,555
And I don't need you
telling me that it won't.

191
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,239
I just....

192
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,035
All right, I really just need you to go.

193
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,797
Sir? Enjoy your meal.

194
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,513
Thank you.

195
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,112
You're late.

196
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,788
Yeah.

197
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,673
We're in the big time now.

198
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,476
So where's the kingpin?

199
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,754
Your guess is as good as mine.

200
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,668
So you get the dude's name?

201
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,439
Nope.

202
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,757
So let me get this straight.
He's allowed to know all our names...

203
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,918
...what we look like,
but not the other way around?

204
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,275
Why don't you get yourself
some food?

205
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,630
So we won't both sit here
with our Happy Meals...

206
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,432
...looking like a couple chumps?

207
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,313
Gentlemen,
is everything to your satisfaction?

208
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,994
Fine, thanks.

209
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,993
This is nothing but an ankle-grab.

210
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,198
I don't get you, man.

211
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,029
A week ago you talked like
you were all ready to hang it up.

212
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,397
We've nearly got 40 pounds
we still need to sell.

213
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,272
Yeah, what about after?

214
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,711
After you gonna make up
some new magic number?

215
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,275
Like, "I got bills. I got bills.
I gotta make more."

216
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,516
What do you want me to say, Jesse?

217
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,157
-Things have changed.
-Oh, I know.

218
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,678
We got a guy killed.

219
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,792
You know what?

220
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,394
This is bullshit.

221
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,316
-I'm out of here.
-Hey.

222
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,792
I think she's waking up from a nap.

223
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,276
She is certainly gonna wanna get out
and stretch those legs soon.

224
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,232
We have to keep an eye
on your fluids.

225
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,032
You're on the low side of normal.

226
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,708
What? How low?

227
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,912
It's not a problem unless we see
a growth drop-off, so we're good.

228
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,476
We'll have you in for an ultrasound
next week and keep an eye on things.

229
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,313
Hey.

230
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,556
Oh, man,
you would not believe the traffic.

231
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,637
That's why I left 40 minutes early.

232
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,751
-Sorry. Hi.
-Hi.

233
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,269
-What did I miss?
-For your refrigerator.

234
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,479
Oh, my God.

235
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,829
Look at her.

236
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,393
-Look.
-Yeah.

237
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,114
God. It's like she's here already.

238
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,756
I was just telling Skyler
everything looks great.

239
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,076
Okay, we've been talking
about it for months now.

240
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,111
It's time to make a decision.

241
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,312
-You know what I'm gonna say.
-The C-section?

242
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,670
And if it's a yes,
we need to schedule it.

243
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,557
Well, my last labour
was pretty tough, so....

244
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,560
For the baby, I say yes.

245
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,399
I agree, considering that your fluids
are on the low side.

246
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,718
It's best we take her a little early.
So why don't we schedule it for...

247
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,319
...a week from Friday?

248
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,798
Isn't that a Friday the 13th?

249
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,072
We have a birthday.

250
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,039
The 16th.

251
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,276
-I like it.
-Yeah.

252
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,630
You know, speaking of birthdays...

253
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,230
...I've got to run back to the office,
so I will see you later?

254
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,113
It's an hour before closing.

255
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,276
You're supposed to be
taking it easy.

256
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,596
We're having a get-together
for Ted's birthday...

257
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,358
...and I've gotta pick up the cake.

258
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,034
Why you?

259
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,555
Because I said I would...?

260
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,228
It is the least I can do.

261
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,235
-Okay?
-Yeah, okay. Yeah.

262
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,759
-Bye.
-Bye.

263
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,278
Let's get out of here.

264
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,596
You know, go do something.

265
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,758
Seriously.

266
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,231
You know that museum in Santa Fe
you talked about?

267
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,677
Let's take a drive.

268
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,073
Sure.

269
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,673
No, I cannot return that stock.
It's been drilled, it's been cut.

270
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,711
We're halfway through the job.

271
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,592
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop, please.</i>
<i>Mr. Beneke to the shop.</i>

272
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,233
All right.
Just let me think about it, okay?

273
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,634
I gotta go.

274
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,751
Dean, I gotta go.

275
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,030
Okay, all right.

276
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,639
Happy birthday!

277
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,708
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,992
Oh, my God. This is beautiful, guys.
Thank you very much.

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,794
Hurry. These candles aren't gonna
hold out much longer.

280
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,478
Wait a minute. You making a wish?
You gotta make a wish.

281
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,389
Okay. Well, let's see.
The economy's in the toilet.

282
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,672
China's undercutting us at every turn.
I'm at a loss.

283
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,314
-Wait. Skyler?
-Yes?

284
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,033
I wanna hear it first.

285
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,399
Absolutely not. No way.

286
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,750
You cannot deny your employer
his birthday wish.

287
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,599
-Yes, I can. Watch me.
-Please!

288
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,429
If this is your birthday wish,
I feel very, very sorry for you.

289
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,950
-Come on. It was so good last time.
-It was ages ago.

290
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,913
And I'm enormous now.

291
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,236
And I don't look anything
like her anymore.

292
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,635
Not that I ever did. I mean, come on.

293
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,149
These candles are getting wax
all over the place.

294
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,032
-Seriously.
-Yes, come on, Skyler.

295
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,756
-<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....</i>
-It's obscene.

296
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,793
<i>Skyler, Skyler, Skyler....</i>

297
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:18,834
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

298
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:25,393
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

299
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,830
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

300
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,158
<i>Of Beneke Fabricators Incorporated</i>

301
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,553
<i>Happy birthday</i>

302
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,032
<i>To you</i>

303
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,472
That was fantastic.

304
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,432
Isn't she great, huh?

305
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,912
Okay, here we go.

306
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,034
-He wasn't there.
-<i>Oh, he was there, all right.</i>

307
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,674
What are you talking about?
I sat there for two hours.

308
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,949
Nobody came.

309
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,674
<i>All I know is my contact</i>
<i>said he was there.</i>

310
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,030
Are you sure you were
at the right restaurant?

311
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,992
<i>Yes, I'm positive.</i>

312
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,633
-Where was he?
-<i>Who knows?</i>

313
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,400
Maybe he checked you out
with a telephoto lens...

314
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,318
...didn't like the cut of your jib.

315
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,718
Anyway, it doesn't matter now
because my contact says it's a no-go.

316
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,272
What? What do you mean?

317
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,799
No deal. No dice.

318
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,877
Shot at and missed. Shit on and hit.

319
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,275
Wait a minute.

320
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,869
How can he make that decision
without even meeting me?

321
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,072
<i>I told you, he's very cautious</i>
<i>who he does business with, all right?</i>

322
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,555
He's skittish, like a deer.

323
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,679
Call him back.

324
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,836
<i>I'm sorry. I can't do that.</i>

325
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,554
Yes, you can. Call him, Saul.

326
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,910
First of all,
I never called him, all right?

327
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,270
I called a guy who called a guy
who called a guy.

328
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,072
Second of all, it's over.

329
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,635
<i>Understand?</i>
<i>With this particular individual...</i>

330
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,115
<i>...all you get is the one shot.</i>

331
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,469
Look...

332
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,194
...I'll see if I can scrape
something else together...

333
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,072
...but don't get your hopes up.

334
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,919
<i>No one else handles</i>
<i>that kind of bulk.</i>

335
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,599
Damn it.

336
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,872
Lucy, you must remember to have
the salt and pepper shakers wiped.

337
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,592
Can I help you, sir?

338
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,550
Diet Coke, please.

339
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,313
And five minutes of your time.

340
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,034
-What can I do for you?
-Have a seat.

341
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,239
Please.

342
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,319
I would like to know why you wouldn't
meet with me yesterday.

343
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,234
I'm sorry. I'm not following.

344
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,789
I sat here yesterday,
waiting to meet with someone.

345
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,875
I believe that person was you.

346
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,471
I think that you're confusing me
for someone else.

347
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,113
I don't think I am.

348
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,832
Sir, if you have a complaint...

349
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,190
...I suggest you submit it
through our e-mail system.

350
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,755
I would be happy to refer you
to our website.

351
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,038
I was told that the man
I would be meeting with...

352
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,435
...is very careful.

353
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,551
A cautious man.

354
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,114
I believe we're alike in that way.

355
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,635
If you are who I think you are...

356
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,151
...you should give me another chance.

357
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,759
I don't think we're alike at all,
Mr. White.

358
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,193
You are not a cautious man at all.

359
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,278
Your partner was late
and he was high.

360
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,039
Yes. Yes, he was.

361
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,872
He's high often, isn't he?

362
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,038
You have poor judgement.

363
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,356
I can't work with someone
with poor judgement.

364
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,552
Are you familiar with my product?

365
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,596
-I've been told it's excellent.
-It is impeccable.

366
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,153
It is the purest...

367
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,670
...most chemically sound product
on the market anywhere.

368
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,110
That is not the only factor.

369
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,108
You could charge twice the current rate
for what I provide...

370
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,675
...and your customers would pay it.

371
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,872
Hands down.

372
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,755
Now, who I choose to do business with
on my end is not your problem.

373
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,868
You won't see him.

374
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,719
You won't interact with him.

375
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,838
Forget he exists.

376
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,515
I have to ask.

377
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,235
Why?

378
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,158
Why him?

379
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,159
Because he does what I say.

380
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,869
Because I can trust him.

381
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,476
How much product
do you have on hand?

382
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,037
Thirty-eight pounds.

383
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,754
Ready to go at a moment's notice.

384
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,512
Will I hear from you?

385
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,399
I have your numbers.

386
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,228
You can never trust a drug addict.

387
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,234
Look, I mean, it's all kind of
little dribs and drabs...

388
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,477
...but right here,
take Keller, for instance.

389
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,070
A couple hundred dollars here,
a few thousand there.

390
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,759
Dribs and drabs.

391
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,951
Once you add it all up, though,
with Keller...

392
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,470
...the revenues are almost 10 percent
less than was actually received.

393
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:08,549
And this is every quarter
for the last two years.

394
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,955
When I saw that, I got worried
so I checked Accounts Receivable.

395
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,038
I found six other instances...

396
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,594
...of revenues being under-reported.

397
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,154
And I've only just started
to look into it.

398
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,591
We have requirement contracts
with a lot of these companies.

399
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,950
They anticipate their needs
for the next quarter.

400
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,957
Most of the time, they overestimate.

401
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,469
I let them roll their overages
into the next order...

402
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,716
...and if I don't, they'll go elsewhere.

403
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,478
Obviously, we forgot...

404
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,514
...or didn't go back
and adjust the revenue entries.

405
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,837
I know it's wrong from an accounting
standpoint, but as you can see...

406
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,510
...the money's coming in eventually,
as you can see.

407
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,879
Right.

408
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,599
Right...

409
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,237
...but I got the old bills of sale
and order forms out of storage...

410
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,715
...to try and sort this out.

411
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,679
Most of the time, there's no backup
for the reported revenues at all.

412
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,031
In a few cases...

413
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,517
...I found xeroxed copies
with the dates changed.

414
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,078
Ted.

415
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,398
All right.

416
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,638
You got me.

417
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:38,836
We're talking nearly a million dollars
of undocumented revenue.

418
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,272
-What are you thinking?
-I'm thinking...

419
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,550
...about saving a company.

420
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,478
I'm thinking about people's jobs...

421
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,398
...about their mortgages
and pensions...

422
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,751
...and their college funds
for their kids.

423
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,709
Not to mention my own.

424
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,388
It doesn't mean that you have to
break the law.

425
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,192
Yes, it does, Skyler.

426
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,231
It's in the books.
Business is terrible.

427
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,591
The bank is on my back,
the IRS is grinding me down to a nub.

428
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,199
-If I don't keep up--
-Ted.

429
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,119
People go to prison for this.

430
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,838
My dad built this company
from nothing.

431
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,035
We make things here.

432
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,152
The people who work here
are like family.

433
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:27,275
I can't let that all fall apart
because of a couple of bad years.

434
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,709
Sky...

435
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,311
...don't report this.

436
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,793
Please.

437
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,474
I'm not gonna turn you in, Ted.

438
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,475
But I can't be a part of it.

439
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,833
I know.

440
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,590
I know. I just wish....

441
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,318
I'm sorry.

442
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,112
I don't want you to go.

443
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,078
<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

444
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,919
<i>Yo, it's Skinny Pete.</i>
<i>Just checking in with you, man.</i>

445
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,872
<i>We missed you at the funeral today.</i>

446
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,479
<i>The whole crew was representing.</i>

447
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,557
<i>Even Badger came</i>
<i>all the way from Fresno.</i>

448
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,751
<i>Combo's people, his ma,</i>
<i>grandma, cousins...</i>

449
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,837
<i>...everyone was all choked up</i>
<i>and shit.</i>

450
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,600
<i>Man, it was, like, emotional.</i>

451
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,677
<i>And you should have</i>
<i>seen the coffin.</i>

452
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,677
<i>It was this shiny white pearlescent.</i>

453
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,838
<i>I'm sure I've seen</i>
<i>the exact same paint job on a Lexus.</i>

454
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,873
<i>So we're definitely talking high-end.</i>

455
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,152
<i>Anyway, guess you had something</i>
<i>bigger going down.</i>

456
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,318
<i>Watch your back out there, bro.</i>
<i>Peace.</i>

457
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,957
I like to mix some ice with it.

458
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,112
Hold that.

459
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,799
What's it feel like?

460
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,038
There's a chill.

461
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,350
Don't freak out. It passes.

462
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,028
And then....

463
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,309
You'll see.

464
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,472
I'll meet you there.

465
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,318
Take that off.

466
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,075
Phones off, please.

467
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,396
Pipes, I guess.

468
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,273
All right, everyone.
Eyes on your paper.

469
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,831
Eyes on your paper.

470
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,594
Yes.

471
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,833
Excuse me, where's the manager?

472
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,235
I'm the manager. Can I help you?

473
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,716
No, no, no.
I met a man here last week.

474
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,673
He's a black gentleman.
He's thin. Glasses.

475
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,359
Yes, sir. That's the owner.

476
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,312
Oh, owner. Okay.

477
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,159
He owns 14 Los Pollos restaurants
in between here and Nevada.

478
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,555
He could be at any one of them.

479
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,116
Is there a phone number
that I can get to...?

480
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,914
I'm sorry, sir. I can't give that out.

481
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,078
Is this about a complaint? I'd be happy
to refer you to our website.

482
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,032
No, no.

483
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,117
-What's his name?
-Gustavo.

484
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,753
Gus.

485
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,915
Thank you.

486
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,349
Thirty-eight pounds, $1.2 million.

487
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,870
Truck stop,
two miles south of Exit 13 on the 25.

488
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,354
-One hour.
-What?

489
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,879
One hour. You in or out?

490
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,517
In. In. Absolutely.
But I just need a little more time.

491
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,631
One hour. If you miss it...

492
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,434
...don't ever show your face
in here again.

493
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,913
Exit 13 off the 25 South,
to a truck....

494
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,112
-Come on! Come on!
-<i>Yo, if I know you, leave a message.</i>

495
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,993
Jesse. Jesse, pick up the phone.

496
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,952
Pick up the phone.

497
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,353
I'm coming by. I need the product.

498
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,278
I need the product now.

499
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,115
Oh, God.

500
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,519
Jesse.

501
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,358
Jesse!

502
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,518
Jesse.

503
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,958
Jesse.

504
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,634
Jesse. Jesse.

505
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,478
Jesse.

506
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,470
Jesse.

507
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,193
Jesse. Jesse, wake up.

508
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,992
Jesse.

509
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,188
Jesse. Jesse, wake up. Wake up.

510
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,469
Wake up!

511
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,193
Come on, damn it.

512
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,628
Wake up.

513
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,915
Where'd you put it?

514
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,792
-Where's the product?
-Get off of me.

515
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,753
Where is it?
Where'd you hide the meth?

516
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,632
-In the kitchen.
-Where?

517
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,351
Under the sink.

518
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,995
No. No, no, no.
Not now, not now. Not now!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

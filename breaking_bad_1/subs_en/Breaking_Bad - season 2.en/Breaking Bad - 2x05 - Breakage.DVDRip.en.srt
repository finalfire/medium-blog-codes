1
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,594
Well, we've come a long way, Walt.

2
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,279
Here at the end of round one...

3
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,630
...I'm gonna recommend
cautious optimism.

4
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,840
We'll check back in two months,
see how you've responded...

5
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,759
...reassess and decide our next move,
if any.

6
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,599
That's right around the time
the baby's due, correct?

7
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,508
Yeah.

8
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,551
Well, try to think of this
as good timing.

9
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,194
You'll start feeling better soon,
more like yourself.

10
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,197
And your hair should start
to come back.

11
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,718
Kind of gotten used
to the old cue-ball look.

12
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,072
-I prefer to think of it as streamlined.
-Right. Aerodynamic.

13
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,478
So no more confusion?

14
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,992
-No more--?
-No. No. Absolutely none.

15
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,519
How are you two holding up?

16
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,675
Fine.

17
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,872
I mean, you know, we're busy...

18
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,640
...but we're good. Absolutely.

19
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,519
It's all good.

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,153
So we're not going through an insurer.
Is that correct?

21
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,157
Yes. Direct bill.

22
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,715
Just need to print it out for you.

23
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,598
Thank you.

24
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,270
I thought we had discussed
a cash discount.

25
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,994
Absolutely. It's included.

26
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,872
Just a reminder.

27
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,675
We do have a payment plan available,
should you be interested.

28
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,075
Oh, yeah.

29
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,713
Okay.

30
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,553
Congratulations.

31
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,438
Thank you.

32
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,638
Okay, well,
then what about the MRI?

33
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,796
Can you--?
Can you please explain to me...

34
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,039
...the distinction between
diagnostic and exploratory?

35
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,152
Yeah, but either way,
his doctor ordered it.

36
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,792
Okay, you know,
it should be covered.

37
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,670
You bet I will. Yeah, in triplicate.

38
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,158
Okay. Well, I'm sorry
you couldn't be of more help too.

39
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,271
Yeah. Okay.

40
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,959
Bitch.

41
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,759
Hi.

42
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,198
Been around someone
who smokes?

43
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,594
No.

44
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,711
The hospital bill came.

45
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,797
-That was fast.
-Yeah.

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,913
Three-day stay,
13,000 and counting.

47
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,436
Is this something that
Gretchen and Elliott might cover?

48
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,239
I mean...

49
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,399
...I know it's strictly your domain,
but....

50
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,591
They will. I'm sure they will.

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,358
I'll handle it.

52
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,396
Oh, God.

53
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,631
Bring me up to speed on
Tuco Salamanca.

54
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,829
-Dead.
-Still?

55
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,156
-Completely.
-Okay, then.

56
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,794
-Well, thanks for stopping by.
-Okay.

57
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,757
So things are quiet, you know.
Not a lot of crystal on the streets now.

58
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,190
-Good.
-Of course, that's not gonna last.

59
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,233
Wait to see who rallies the roaches
now that turf's up for grabs.

60
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,793
No takers so far?

61
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,197
Well, we keep hearing a name.
Heisenberg.

62
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,709
Lately pretty much every dime-bagger
we come across.

63
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,115
-Heisenberg?
-Yeah, I know.

64
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,880
Maybe it's a tweaker urban legend.

65
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,039
Still, somebody somewhere is cooking
that big blue we keep finding.

66
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,595
Anyway, we'll stay on it.

67
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,994
Know why sharks are at the top
of the food chain, Hank?

68
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,312
Because they have three sets of teeth
and will take a bite out of anything?

69
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,909
Some of those suckers
travel thousands of miles...

70
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,111
...in pursuit of their prey.

71
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,197
Yeah, I think I heard that.

72
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,194
You, my friend, are a great white.

73
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,192
How does Albuquerque liaison...

74
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,597
...Tri-State Border Interdiction
Task Force sound?

75
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,839
Like one hell of a promotion.

76
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,555
As of the 1st, I want you to split
your time between here and El Paso.

77
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,069
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

78
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,238
What you gonna do without me,
Gomey?

79
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,876
Celebrate. I won't have to look
at your ugly mug six days a week.

80
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,753
Hey, buddy,
I am the brains and the brawn.

81
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,269
-I'm the whole package.
-I'm glad I didn't just eat.

82
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,835
I'm surprised your head still fits
through the door.

83
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,600
-You wanna grab lunch?
-Hell, yeah. Because you're buying.

84
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,439
Done.
I'll meet you morons downstairs.

85
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,517
Try not to get lost on the way.

86
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,631
Schrader.

87
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,909
Yeah. Hey, Ricky.

88
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,634
How you doing?
Yeah, I'm stoked too.

89
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,432
Yeah, El Paso.

90
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,834
Here's the man.

91
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,829
-Hey, congratulations, Hank.
-Thanks.

92
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,153
Gets two in the sand,
two in the forest, you know?

93
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,511
And then he says,
"Give me a four," you know?

94
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,278
Hey. Hey.

95
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,630
-Hey.
-Got some nerve coming back here.

96
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,671
Or you're even dumber
than I thought.

97
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,916
Yeah, well, maybe both.

98
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,638
Balance for the tow, the repairs...

99
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,436
...and extra for damages and stuff,
the gate...

100
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,313
...the toilet.

101
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,716
Look, like I said...

102
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,673
...my word is my bond.

103
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,474
What would you charge me
to store this here?

104
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,478
-A million-five.
-Come on, yo.

105
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,796
-Your sister.
-Dog, I'm serious, all right?

106
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,437
I got storage needs.
And I got scratch up front.

107
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,949
We could, you know, negotiate.

108
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,189
Five hundred.

109
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,628
-A month?
-A week.

110
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,439
For real?

111
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,198
-See you.
-Wait, wait, wait.

112
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,516
Just hold on. Just chill.

113
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,033
Okay. Sounds good. Totally doable.

114
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,231
-Outside.
-Inside.

115
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,998
-Forget it.
-Man, come on.

116
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,113
Your fence is too easy to climb.

117
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,754
Inside, padlocked,
plus gate privileges.

118
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,748
-Come again?
-Gate, in and out, privileges.

119
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,469
Month to month. Cash up front.
Inside.

120
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,114
And I don't know you.
I don't know jack.

121
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,548
Yeah.

122
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,590
You selling?

123
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,631
I'll let you take it for nine Gs.

124
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,117
What about that one?

125
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,359
Serious?

126
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,714
It's Jane, right?

127
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,230
Well, Jane, I gotta say,
this place is awesome.

128
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,274
-Really? Does it inspire awe?
-No. I mean, you know, it's great.

129
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,789
Just what I've been looking for.
That's what I meant.

130
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,753
I had an entire house before,
detached and all...

131
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,112
...but I was just tired of the lawn care,
upkeep and whatnot. You know?

132
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,198
Well, the blinds are new.
Everything's been painted.

133
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,989
Jesus.

134
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,435
Utilities are included.

135
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,358
Stacking. Sweet.

136
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,154
-You got cable?
-Already wired. Just call to activate.

137
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,918
High speed, whatever.

138
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,680
Bathroom, cool tile.

139
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,632
Bedroom.

140
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,909
Nice.

141
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,157
I'm a fan of the hardwood.

142
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,437
-So you're interested?
-Definitely. Definitely, yeah.

143
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,517
And you're good with NP, NS?

144
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,115
Sorry. What?

145
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,357
In the ad? No smoking, no pets.
You wanna smoke, you do it outside.

146
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,358
No. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
It's cool. No worries.

147
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,473
All right, the usual drill. I'll need a W-2
or recent pay stub, current employer...

148
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,148
...former address, you know,
the yadda yadda.

149
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,875
And if it's all copacetic, I'll call.

150
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,553
Yeah. Look...

151
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,159
...the thing is...

152
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,918
...I can....

153
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,519
Unbelievable.

154
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,190
-I'm just currently between situations.
-Then I'm currently not renting.

155
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,870
Look, look, I got the money and
I'm totally good for it for, like, ever.

156
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,390
Come on, yo, can you please,
please just help a brother out?

157
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,068
Yo, my dad's not really
a make-exceptions kind of guy.

158
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,350
-Trust me.
-Your dad?

159
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,233
Owns the place. I manage it.

160
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,556
Pen on paper. That's what I need.

161
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,398
Or go run your game
somewhere else.

162
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,716
Dude, I got nowhere else to go.
This is it.

163
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,195
And I got no game, all right?

164
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,914
I just need a chance.

165
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,276
Look, my folks, they kicked me out.

166
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,313
I'm a disappointment, apparently.

167
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,273
Didn't meet their expectations again.

168
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:40,153
So you know, now
I'm persona non gratis or whatever.

169
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,319
But you know what?
I'm a good person and I work hard.

170
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,829
I will pay you every month
and I will pay you on time.

171
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,873
I will not mess this up, okay?
I swear.

172
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,629
Rent just went up.

173
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,515
A hundred more a month.
That's the cash price.

174
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,199
Yes.

175
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,353
Okay. Yes.

176
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,154
Hey, you rock. Thank you.
Thank you. You won't regret this.

177
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,954
And in addition to first and last,
I want two more months.

178
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,515
DBAA fee, non-refundable.

179
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,077
Yeah, of course. No problem.
DBAA. Obviously, yeah.

180
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,748
All right. So, what's DBAA?

181
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,190
-Don't be an asshole.
-Gotcha.

182
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,834
-I live next door.
-Really?

183
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,237
Don't think for one second you have
squatter's rights, because you don't.

184
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,919
If you blow this, I want you gone.

185
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,078
I know guys that'll have your skinny
ass out back by the Dumpster...

186
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,599
...faster than you can blink.

187
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,951
I'll fill it in. Just sign your name.

188
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,388
Which is what, by the way?

189
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,795
It's Jesse.

190
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,635
Jesse Jackson.

191
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,715
Seriously?

192
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,475
What?

193
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,988
-What are you doing?
-Beating off. What's it look like?

194
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,510
That is in fact exactly
what it looks like to me.

195
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,678
Brewing is an art form, Marie.
I think you'd appreciate that by now.

196
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,758
Christmas, batch of '06? Come on.

197
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,030
So let me get this straight.

198
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,631
You call in sick the day after
receiving a long-awaited...

199
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,070
...career-boosting promotion...

200
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,398
...so you can play Oktoberfest
in your man cave?

201
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,878
I don't get it. Really, I don't.

202
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,957
Babe, relax.

203
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,360
-Please, don't tell me to relax.
-Sorry, I forgot.

204
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,471
-You know I hate that.
-Right.

205
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,352
Dave said I should express that.

206
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,154
All I'm saying is everything's fine.

207
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,599
I can take a day.

208
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,438
No big deal.

209
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,397
Now get that sweet ass out of here
so I can concentrate.

210
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,478
<i>Okay, so, what's the plan?</i>

211
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,875
The plan is we cook.

212
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,312
Why are we cooking when we can't
even move what we cook?

213
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,388
Well, how much do you think
you can sell on your own?

214
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,194
Say if I cook during the days
and you work the nights.

215
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,118
-Dude.
-What?

216
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,035
Prior to Tuco,
that was your plan, wasn't it?

217
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,516
I understand it'll be a fraction
of what we brought in before...

218
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,792
-...but still, what choice do we have?
-First of all, there's no we.

219
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,913
Okay? You're talking me, solo,
busting hump slinging shards.

220
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,269
I got profile now.

221
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,552
Don't you get that?
DEA's up my ass.

222
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,991
No, I'm not exposing myself
to that level of risk for chump change.

223
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,634
-No way.
-Then what do you suggest?

224
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,516
I don't think either of us are eager
to jump into bed with another Tuco.

225
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,634
I got bills, man.

226
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,068
You've got bills?

227
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,032
Rent, yo. Responsibilities.

228
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,958
I've already lost more than
I've made...

229
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,720
...and I am tired
of dicking around out here.

230
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,832
You wanna know how much
I've got left?

231
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,031
After completing
my first round of treatment...

232
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,596
...and financing
the world's most expensive alibi?

233
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,677
Zero. Zip. Nothing.

234
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,838
I've got nothing to show for all of this.
Nothing for my family...

235
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,316
...which, as you might remember,
was the whole damn point.

236
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,515
But seeing as throwing in the towel
is not an option...

237
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,632
...that leaves us with a total
of two choices.

238
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,752
We go into business
with yet another homicidal lunatic...

239
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,916
...or you and I start--

240
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,715
You selling whatever you can.

241
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,511
There's a third way.

242
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,758
And what would that be?

243
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,472
We got to be Tuco.

244
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,955
All right? Cut out the middleman.
Run our own game.

245
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,835
So you're going to what?

246
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,110
Snort meth off a bowie knife?

247
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,232
You gonna beat your homeys to death
when they "dis" you?

248
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,797
Look, I know some guys.
All right? I can create a network.

249
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,709
Look, we control production
and distribution.

250
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,992
That way, we stay off the front lines
while moving some serious glass.

251
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,112
I mean, the point here is
to make money, right?

252
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,548
Sky-high stacks.

253
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,238
-No.
-No? That's not the point?

254
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,908
No, I am not willing to do that.

255
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,631
Who said anything about you?

256
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,591
I don't vote for this plan.

257
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,793
I'm not comfortable bringing in
unknown entities into our operation.

258
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,434
Yeah? Well, you don't get to vote.

259
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,996
I beg your pardon?

260
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,829
-This is a partnership, remember?
-I rem-- Oh, I remember.

261
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,076
Yeah, you cook, I sell.

262
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,431
That was the division of labour
when we started all this.

263
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,710
And that's exactly
how we should have kept it.

264
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,639
Because I sure as hell didn't
find myself locked in a trunk...

265
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,956
...or on my knees
with a gun to my head...

266
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,993
...before your greedy old ass
came along. All right?

267
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,917
All right, I will admit
to a bit of a learning curve.

268
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,908
And perhaps
I was overly ambitious.

269
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,029
In any case, it's not gonna happen
that way anymore.

270
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,832
Yeah, damn straight.

271
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,951
Know why?

272
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,833
Because we do things
my way this time...

273
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,792
...or I walk.

274
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,312
You need me more than
I need you, Walt.

275
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,039
Yo, enter my <i>casa.</i>
Yo, Skinny Pete. What's up, brother?

276
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,195
What up with it, yo?

277
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,517
Hey, Combo. Good to see you.
Welcome to my humble abode.

278
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,359
Good deal, mover. Good deal.

279
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,359
-Yo, Badge, hey.
-Cool crib, man.

280
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,118
Hey, it echoes.

281
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,878
Hello.

282
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,957
Hello. Hello, hello, hello.

283
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,798
Let me give you the virtual tour,
okay?

284
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,434
So plasma is gonna go right here.

285
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,596
Probably like 50-inch,
you know, wall-mounted.

286
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,916
Plasma rocks it over LCD, yo.

287
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,712
No. They burn in, yo.

288
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,912
But the picture's, like, way sharper.
Blacks are deeper too.

289
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,588
They got 3-D coming out,
like, any day now.

290
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,392
That's what I'm waiting for.

291
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,716
-Porn, coz. You know?
-Jesus.

292
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,309
Like 3-D tatas,
like right in your face.

293
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,273
Yeah. So, I'm gonna get a couple
of those zero-gravity chairs...

294
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,199
...for, like, right here,
for your ultimate viewing comfort.

295
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,469
Those are buck.

296
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,558
It's gonna be pretty much sparse.
Very Asiany, modern stuff.

297
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,796
-Feng shui, yo. I can dig it.
-Yeah.

298
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,116
I'm thinking, you know,
just a bunch of candles...

299
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,629
...maybe one of those
little fountain jobs right here.

300
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,558
-It's gonna be chill.
-The ladies...

301
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,355
...they cream up real nice for,
like, candles and shit.

302
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,549
You are going to score, big time.

303
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,037
All right, so how about we get,
you know, down to it?

304
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,232
There's some refreshments over here
if you wanna partake.

305
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,910
You got any other refreshments?

306
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,873
-I could kick it. It's been a while.
-Yes, yes.

307
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,389
I could totally go
for a loving spoonful.

308
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,750
No, no, no.
No bomb, no beer, no weed. All right?

309
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,430
You smoke it up on your own time.
We're talking business here.

310
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,151
Okay? So listen up.

311
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,875
This is how it goes.
I front each of you an ounce.

312
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,834
You sell it for 2,500.
I keep the two, you keep the five.

313
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,679
No cutting it.
You sell it as is, all right?

314
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,235
Twenty-five hundred an ounce?

315
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,873
That's kind of hopeful, bro.

316
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,390
-Yeah, Jesse, street's maybe 17, 18.
-Seventeen.

317
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,149
Okay, A, this is the best shiz ever.

318
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,636
All right? Everybody and their mother's
gonna want a taste. And second...

319
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,831
...who else is selling right now,
huh?

320
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,952
-It's dry out there, that's for sure.
-Church.

321
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,277
So you point it how you want, okay?
Quarter, half, teener, whatever.

322
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,517
But I make what I make.
Two large. No exceptions.

323
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,836
Short me, you're out.

324
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,553
Cut it, you're out.

325
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,318
Period.

326
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,274
This is a big opportunity
I am giving you.

327
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,959
Understand?

328
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,674
Badger, what is this?

329
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,313
A big opportunity.

330
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,830
Exactly. All right?
This is the ground floor.

331
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,396
Gentlemen,
how far you go is up to you.

332
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,999
So bring out the product, yo.

333
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,839
No, no, no. Not here, all right?
Not ever.

334
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,828
Blind drop. I will let you know
when and where.

335
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,438
All right?
So you'll be hearing from me.

336
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,358
Now, I got mad volume.

337
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,075
So you move it quick,
you move it right...

338
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,272
...there is always more.

339
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,797
Okay, DBAA, mofos. All right?

340
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,116
Apply yourselves.

341
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,355
Hell, yeah.

342
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,477
Hell, yeah.

343
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,549
Hey, there's the big guy.

344
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,910
-Congratulations, Uncle Hank.
-Hey, Hank.

345
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,235
It's an armpit.

346
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,112
It's not an armpit.

347
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,878
Oh, excuse me.

348
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,514
You're right.
It's the Paris of the Southwest.

349
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,995
Please, it's Texas, for God's sake.

350
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,431
Right on the border
of lawless Mexican hell.

351
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,631
Human heads, they leave.

352
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,753
The cartels, they litter the place
with human heads.

353
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,235
Yeah, well, pretty sure
that's why I'm going there.

354
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,874
It's like a calling card
or a shoutout or something.

355
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,833
Now, D.C., on the other hand,
I could get behind.

356
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,554
You just do your time
like a good boy...

357
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,593
...and I could see us
in a cute little condo in Georgetown...

358
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,472
...in a couple of years.

359
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,908
I went online to this fantastic...

360
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,918
...real estate website for D.C.

361
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,716
There's just so much,
I don't know, culture there.

362
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,876
I was talking to Melinda,
Hank's boss's wife.

363
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,992
I told you about the one with
helmet hair and permanent lip liner.

364
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,316
Anyway, she was saying that
when they were there--

365
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,393
Apologise.

366
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,999
What?

367
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:38,389
I will not listen to one more word
until you apologise.

368
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,959
-For?
-You know perfectly well, Marie.

369
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,038
-Well, obviously I don't--
-Your lies.

370
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,753
To me.

371
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,156
The shoplifting.

372
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,873
All of it.

373
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,358
Did you really think it was all just
neatly gonna go away?

374
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,518
Well, if you hadn't tried to return it--

375
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,473
Apologise.

376
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,756
Now or never. I mean it.

377
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,315
Or it'll never be the same.

378
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,869
Why are you punishing me?

379
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,870
If you don't respect me enough to
apologise, to tell me the truth, then--

380
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,357
I need my sister back.

381
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,398
I'm sorry.

382
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,512
I'm sorry.

383
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,111
-What, do you want the gory details?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

384
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,038
No, you don't.

385
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,037
Keep you up at night.

386
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,670
So was it scary?

387
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,314
Hell, yeah, it was freaking scary,
you little punk.

388
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,509
Jesus.

389
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,473
But you were way faster than him.

390
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,958
Well, I'm here, aren't I?

391
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,751
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

392
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,234
Kick ass and take names.

393
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,113
-Son.
-No, it's fine.

394
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,037
You know what it is?

395
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,755
A cockroach comes out
from under a fridge, what do you do?

396
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,791
I mean, you don't think about it.

397
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,550
You stomp them down.

398
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,593
Where do they come from?

399
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,508
Criminals, like the one you....

400
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,269
I mean, what do you think it is
that makes them who they are?

401
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,753
Buddy, you might as well be
asking me about the roaches.

402
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,951
All I know is there's a whole world
of them out there.

403
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,319
Man, I gotta piss like a racehorse.

404
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,755
Cops.

405
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,958
Cops!

406
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,556
Wasn't sure it was you.

407
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,714
New car?

408
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,549
Yeah, keeping things on the DL.

409
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,752
I'm guessing
this one doesn't bounce.

410
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,511
Your half.

411
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,075
Fifteen K.
That's what I'm talking about.

412
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,119
You're welcome.

413
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,309
Jesus.

414
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,796
Help me understand the math,
okay?

415
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,797
I gave you 1 pound, correct?

416
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,798
You and I split $2,000 per ounce.

417
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,718
$1,000 each.

418
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,751
One pound, that's 16 ounces.

419
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,590
Sixteen ounces should net
to me $16,000.

420
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,633
Sixteen. Not 15.

421
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,519
Something came up.

422
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,234
Something came up?

423
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,398
One of my guys got held up
by a couple junkies.

424
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:20,991
Lost an ounce. But it's cool, okay?
Skinny Pete's cool.

425
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,553
So you're saying
that your guy got robbed--

426
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,880
Or rather you got robbed.
--but it doesn't matter.

427
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,433
Dude, it's called breakage, okay?

428
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,278
Like Kmart. Shit breaks.

429
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,357
And you're thinking
this is acceptable?

430
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,518
It's the cost of business, yo.

431
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,119
You're sweating me over a grand?

432
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,552
Hey, look, I'm just the chemist here.
I'm not the street guy, yo.

433
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,910
But it seems to me
that what you call breakage...

434
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:53,078
...is just you making a fool
of yourself.

435
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,996
I've got another technical
term for you.

436
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,830
Non-sustainable business model.

437
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,190
You're focusing on the negative.

438
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,836
Six grand a day we're making.
What's your problem?

439
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,751
What happens when
word gets out...

440
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,236
...and it's open season
on these clowns you've hired?

441
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,238
Once everyone knows that
Jesse Pinkman...

442
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,353
...drug lord,
can be robbed with impunity.

443
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,788
Man, come on.

444
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,310
You think Tuco had breakage?

445
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,032
I guess it's true, he did.

446
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,309
He broke bones.

447
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,317
He broke the skull of anybody
who tried to rip him off.

448
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,909
You want another grand?
Is that it?

449
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,270
-That's not my point.
-Take it. Here.

450
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,758
Look, you got 15,000
you didn't have yesterday.

451
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,030
Hey, we're making bank.
Shit happens.

452
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,754
My guys get what they're up against
and they're careful.

453
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,234
So am I.

454
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,034
And you're all tucked in at night
with your precious family.

455
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,993
So why don't you just stop being
such a freak about everything?

456
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,953
You've made
the division of labour very clear.

457
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,636
Yo, I mean, seriously...

458
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,196
...what the hell
do you want me to do, huh?

459
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,275
Hey.

460
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,674
Sorry.

461
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,552
Wow, you snuck in.

462
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,751
Didn't even know you were home.

463
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,989
What you eating?

464
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,112
A panini. There's another one
in the freezer if you want it.

465
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,918
I thought we nixed those, huh?

466
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,758
Did we?

467
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,191
Yeah. I mean, aren't those the ones
with the off-the-chart sodium?

468
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,792
I had a craving.

469
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,070
Once in a while is no big deal.

470
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,473
So where's Jr.?

471
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,554
Out.

472
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,956
With whom?

473
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,559
Louis.

474
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,396
Out where?

475
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,638
Somewhere. I don't know.

476
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,513
-He'll be back by 9.
-Okay.

477
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,835
Yeah, I just thought you might
have a clue where your son is.

478
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,553
Why don't you?

479
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,839
Why am I the only one who needs
to keep track of our son?

480
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,349
I'll tell you what.
Wanna know where he is, ask him.

481
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,710
Just pick up the phone like I do.

482
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,319
Great.

483
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,992
Perhaps you might know
something...

484
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,315
...about this.

485
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,035
Perhaps.

486
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,949
And then again...

487
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,076
...perhaps I don't, Walt.

488
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,590
Perhaps I smoked them
in a fugue state.

489
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,477
I'd like an explanation, please.

490
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,433
-You don't wanna go down that road.
-Why would you do this?

491
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,552
-You're pregnant, for God's sakes.
-Three and a half cigarettes...

492
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,159
...won't do a thing to the baby.

493
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,396
-Nothing.
-I'm glad you're so sure, doctor.

494
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,068
Three and a half. That was it.
I tossed the rest.

495
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,991
And I'm sure you'll be very glad
to hear that, yes, I feel ashamed.

496
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,678
Skyler, this--
I mean, this is something that--

497
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,997
-This is so unlike you. Why--?
-Really?

498
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,031
How would you know?

499
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,671
No, thank you.

500
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,949
Hank.

501
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,468
Jesus.

502
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,711
Yo.

503
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,911
You asked me what
I want you to do.

504
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,228
I want you to handle it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,833
All right, everybody. Listen up.

2
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,397
Tuco Salamanca. For those of you
who were not with us this morning...

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,670
...we raided his headquarters.

4
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,632
Also his last-known address.

5
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,753
Even the little den of iniquity
he keeps for his meth-hag girlfriend.

6
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,396
We netted a bunch of his lieutenants.
The man himself smelled us coming.

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,038
So study the face. Study the file.

8
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,515
Get a big old raging hard-on...

9
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,871
...at the idea
of catching this piece of shit.

10
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,676
My apologies
to the H.R. department.

11
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,555
Grow tumescent with anticipation.

12
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,239
All right.

13
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,271
On the hit parade, 1998.

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,357
Reputed to have whacked
one "Dog" Paulson...

15
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,313
...back when our bandidos
were wresting the crank trade away...

16
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,999
...from the SoCal biker gangs.

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,476
Also, we're pretty sure
he knifed a Mexican national in '03.

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,150
And for my money, seeing
how he customarily deals with rivals...

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,874
...I'd say he is a prime suspect
in the disappearance...

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,230
...of our dearly missed Krazy-8.

21
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,276
Hats over your heart for that dirtball.

22
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,391
We hauled Tuco in
for questioning on that...

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,033
...but we couldn't make it stick.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,708
Yeah, he runs a tight ship.
Smug bastard.

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,677
And even worse, El Paso says he's
got some kind of cartel connection.

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Yeah, yeah. I know. We all know
what's going on down there.

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,878
We sure don't want it going on
up here...

28
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,798
...which brings us to the good news.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,312
We finally got some actual,
honest-to-God evidence.

30
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,236
This is one of Tuco's henchmen.
Street name: No-Doze.

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,796
Found him tucked in the junkyard
along with Tuco's own brother-in-law...

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,558
...a.k.a. Gonzo.

33
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,038
Gonzo, this rocket scientist,
was moving No-Doze's body--

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,515
Either hiding it there
or pulling it out. Not sure.

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,030
--when he got his arm crushed
clean off.

36
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,152
Anyone wanna see the photos,
they're on my website. Hilarious.

37
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,237
Anyway. The upshot is...

38
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,560
...we got us a nice, big, juicy,
bloody fingerprint...

39
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,036
...which belongs to Señor Tuco.

40
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,676
Christmas came early
to the Schrader household.

41
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,190
That is, provided we find this guy.

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,553
So to all present, I ask you,
you wanna find this guy?

43
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,149
-Yes.
-Yes.

44
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,713
What the hell was that? Jesus.

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,318
Wanna try that again?

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,592
-Do you wanna find this guy?
-Yes!

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,234
-Are we going to find this guy?
-Yes!

48
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,668
-Louder, damn it!
-Yes!

49
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,711
-Give me a "hell, yeah!"
-Hell, yeah!

50
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,558
-Hell, yeah!
-Hell, yeah!

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,116
<i>Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah, Hell, yeah.</i>

52
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,959
They ain't gonna find him.

53
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,276
Guy is in <i>México</i> by now.

54
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,358
Appearances, Gomey.
It's all about appearances.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,718
Listen, I gotta take
some personal time.

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,558
Now, in the middle of a manhunt?

57
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,110
Skyler called last night.
It's Walt. He's missing.

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,312
Just disappeared from the house,
and no one's heard from him since.

59
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,353
Damn. You don't think he...?

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,799
Holler if you need me.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,753
All right. Thanks a lot, man.
Appreciate that.

62
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,878
This is the most recent photo.
We haven't taken many lately, so....

63
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,038
But that's what he looks like now.

64
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,471
Without the hair.

65
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,239
Hey, it's me.

66
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,792
Hey, Tim. Really appreciate you
sparing us your day off.

67
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,309
No worries. Happy to help.

68
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,670
Yeah, this is helpful. Good.

69
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,155
-What about height and weight?
-Five eleven...

70
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,396
...most recently, about 170.

71
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,833
One sixty-five. That's what I weigh.

72
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,759
I guess he weighs a little less.

73
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,077
That's fine.
That's close enough. Good.

74
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,510
What about
other distinguishing features?

75
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,915
Tattoos or moles or scars?

76
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,955
-Anything that might help us.
-Tattoos? No. Not really. No.

77
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,879
That's fine.

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,832
-Is that the list of medications?
-Yes.

79
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,429
I wrote them all down.
And there's no drug interactions.

80
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,189
None that are listed.
I called his doctor, so, no.

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,793
Has he been depressed?

82
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,354
He's been withdrawn lately.
A little withdrawn.

83
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,195
Yeah.

84
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,510
Last night, he was agitated.

85
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,789
Agitated?

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,278
Yeah. When he came home last night,
he was agitated, upset.

87
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,029
Upset in general? Or upset
because of something particular?

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,435
When I asked him what was wrong,
he said:

89
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,079
"I don't know where to begin."

90
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,994
Then he just walked out of the room--
Out of the bathroom.

91
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,758
I was in the tub, taking a bath.

92
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,872
--and when I came out
about 10 minutes later, he was gone.

93
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,558
Nothing else missing?

94
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,554
His keys, wallet, cell phone.
Just what was on him.

95
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,277
But-- What about the phone call?

96
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,669
I'm looking into it.

97
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,636
-What phone call?
-Walt's cell phone rang.

98
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,992
He pulled it out, looked at it,
and didn't answer it.

99
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,670
But then, a short time after,
he wandered out of the bathroom.

100
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,598
I mean...

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,552
...couldn't that be...

102
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,557
...important, right?

103
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,958
Anything else you can think of?

104
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,592
Anything else.

105
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,836
No. I called
the credit card providers...

106
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,955
...and there's no report
of any recent activity.

107
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,312
I-- Let's see. I checked
with every hospital within 50 miles.

108
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,511
Every police station. Every morgue.

109
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,280
So, no, I really don't--
I don't have anything else.

110
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,836
I was actually hoping
that you had something else...

111
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,429
...being that you're the expert.

112
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,033
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,514
No worries.

114
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,315
I think this is good enough to start.
Gives us plenty to work on.

115
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,839
-Mrs. White.
-Thank you.

116
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,349
-Walter.
-Thank you.

117
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,878
So that cell-phone call
she's talking about? I ran it.

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,911
-And?
-Never happened.

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,519
No record of it.

120
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,915
-Second cell phone.
-Yeah. I'm thinking.

121
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,274
I understand.

122
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,919
Out.

123
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,989
Get away from me!

124
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,955
Settle down, bitch.

125
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,278
You gonna shoot me, huh?
Shoot me in here!

126
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,675
I hope I bleed like a mother too!

127
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,836
That way, you have to clean it up!

128
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,994
It's your ride, retard.

129
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,031
I ain't gotta clean jack. Now, get out.

130
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,752
Get up.

131
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,198
Get up.

132
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,473
Oh, my God.

133
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,671
Don't do this, Tuco.

134
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,877
No more posters?

135
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,028
Walter Jr.'s making more.

136
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,517
Thank you, Marie.

137
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,834
I don't think he'll hurt himself.

138
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,430
I mean, he just doesn't strike me
as the type.

139
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,198
He'll turn up.

140
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,035
Okay, the whole tiara thing...

141
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,630
-...I just find it bewildering that...
-Marie.

142
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,593
-...you didn't believe that--
-Marie.

143
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,118
Not now.

144
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,152
Empty your pockets.

145
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,070
Thought your name was
Heisenberg...

146
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,954
..."Walter Hartwell White."

147
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,232
Heisenberg is kind of a pseudonym.

148
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,796
You know, a business name.

149
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,071
Yeah.

150
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,669
I like doing business
with a family man.

151
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,350
There's always a lot of collateral.

152
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,554
Answer me one thing.

153
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,036
Can I trust you?

154
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,310
Yes. Yes, absolutely.

155
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,591
Sit down.

156
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,792
DEA...

157
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,075
...hit my place of business
this morning.

158
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,396
About a hundred cops
looking for me.

159
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,917
-You two haven't been talking, right?
-No.

160
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,473
No.

161
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,352
Picked up my whole crew,
top to bottom.

162
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,473
Everybody except Gonzo.

163
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,636
That's weird, right?

164
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,150
I mean, don't you think
that that's weird?

165
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,954
It's weird. Yes.

166
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,479
Unusual.

167
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,958
Unusual.

168
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,630
Last two days,
I couldn't get Gonzo on the phone.

169
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,952
He's been acting all pouty
on account of No-Doze.

170
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,511
Explain to me.

171
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,596
How is it my fault that that little
bitch did not know his place?

172
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,077
I saw this coming.

173
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,709
I can see the future, you know?

174
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,391
It's this gift that I have
deep inside my head.

175
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,828
I knew last night they were gonna
come try and bust me.

176
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,475
Gonzo.

177
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,754
He went and snitched to the cops!
That lousy son of a bitch!

178
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,396
I trusted him like a brother!
I was good to him! I was good!

179
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,036
I see Gonzo, I'm gonna gut him,
I'm gonna skin him...

180
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,596
...and I'm gonna stuff his hide
for a heavy bag...

181
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,759
...and every time I hit him,
it's gonna be like a lesson to myself!

182
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,839
You never,
never trust the people that you love!

183
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,557
So you plan to ice Gonzo,
like, future tense?

184
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,595
What?

185
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,795
You're saying, Tuco....

186
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,673
You're saying that Gonzo...

187
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,998
...is currently operating
as a police informant...

188
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,349
...as far as you know?

189
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,795
I'm very sorry to hear that.

190
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,712
That's disappointing.

191
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,275
Yeah.

192
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,313
-I'd waste him too, yo.
-Shut up.

193
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,839
Okay.

194
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,794
They're out there looking for me
right now.

195
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,673
They got ghetto birds
and black ops.

196
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,839
I need to get high.
I need to get good and high.

197
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,469
What's with this gak?
It smells like headcheese.

198
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,550
No, it's-- It's killer.

199
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,234
Yeah, seriously.

200
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,479
So I was thinking last night.

201
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,238
I came up with this great idea.

202
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,797
-Mexico?
-We'll disappear way out in the jungle.

203
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,672
We'll set you up in a superlab.

204
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,269
We'll do nothing but cook 24/7.

205
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,277
And no Federales
are gonna mess with us...

206
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,596
...because I got my people there.

207
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,518
Connections.

208
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,755
We're going to make beaucoup bucks,
Heisenberg, huh?

209
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,951
Tuco, I....

210
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,670
I have a wife and family.

211
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,916
So what? You'll get another one.

212
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,999
I don't want you to take
this the wrong way, but I can't just...

213
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,475
...uproot my life like that.

214
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,557
Yeah, man. I mean, me neither.

215
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,118
Who's talking to you?

216
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,233
You need me, man...

217
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,477
...because I cooked that scante
in your hands.

218
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,632
Yeah.

219
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,353
I'll tell you something, yo.

220
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,279
You never tried nothing like it.

221
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,516
Stink or no stink...

222
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,998
...one bump,
you'll be flying high for days.

223
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,435
It's a new product him
and I've been working up.

224
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,870
Careful when you hit it.

225
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,799
It kicks like a 12 gauge
when it comes on.

226
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,150
It's got a secret ingredient.

227
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,793
What secret ingredient?

228
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,677
Chilli powder.

229
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,959
I hate chilli powder.

230
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,718
This blue magic, this is money.

231
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,828
You keep cooking this, Heisenberg.

232
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,954
We're gonna rewrite history
with this.

233
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,799
All right. Time to clean the menudo
out from between your ears.

234
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,750
No, no, no. No, I need him, Tuco.

235
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,871
I need him very, very badly.

236
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,229
He's my partner.

237
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,308
And if he doesn't go, I don't go.

238
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,477
I'll tell you this. My cousins
are driving up here right now...

239
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,353
...to smuggle us back,
and they're gonna be here by sunset...

240
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,870
...and you're gonna be on that truck,
or you're gonna be dead!

241
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,279
And you....

242
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,313
You better hope they got room
in the trunk.

243
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,114
-Where are you going?
-Louis is taking me to the train station.

244
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,992
We'll put these up.

245
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,034
-No, no, honey. No, I'll do it.
-He wants to help, let him help.

246
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,516
I mean, how long has it been
since you've slept?

247
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,637
Yeah, she's right, Sky.
Why don't you lay down a while?

248
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,158
For chrissake,
you got a bun in the oven.

249
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,556
I got my cell if you need me.

250
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,751
-Okay?
-Okay.

251
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,635
-Bye, sweetie. I'll see you later.
-All right. Bye.

252
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,756
Actually, I think the very fact
they haven't found him yet...

253
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,712
...bodes well.

254
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,952
Well, I mean, if he-- You know.

255
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,872
Somebody would've
smelled something by now.

256
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,556
There's got to be something.

257
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,557
Some detail
that we haven't picked up on.

258
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,950
-What about the second cell phone?
-Jesus.

259
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,630
What? We can't just ignore
a potential clue, Hank.

260
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,996
Okay. What are you talking about?

261
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,079
The call you said Walt got
before he disappeared?

262
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,475
There's no record of it
with the phone company.

263
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,310
No incoming,
no dropped calls, nothing.

264
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,476
But his phone rang. I heard it.

265
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,634
All right. Well, then if that's the case,
he must have a second phone.

266
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,234
Why? What sense would there be
in that?

267
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,352
Yeah. All right. Okay.
I'm not here to argue with you.

268
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,872
No, Hank. You can't just bring up
secret cell phone and then drop it.

269
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,036
What does it mean?

270
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,276
I don't know, Sky.
What do you want me to say?

271
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,433
It means Walt has a secret.

272
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,315
Everyone's got one from somebody,
big or little.

273
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,239
-Okay. Everyone. Okay.
-Skyler, come on.

274
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,194
He kept cancer from you for weeks.

275
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,799
Okay, then, let's assume
there's a second cell phone.

276
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,309
So what?
What, is he having an affair?

277
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,757
Walt? Please.

278
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,353
-What about the marijuana?
-He's not on pot anymore.

279
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,471
Says who? Him?

280
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,716
Chemotherapy
and marijuana go together...

281
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,674
...like apple pie and Chevrolet.

282
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,351
Maybe he's addicted to the pot...

283
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,516
...and he owes his drug dealer
a lot of money.

284
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,678
Marie, you don't get hooked on pot
like that.

285
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,713
How do you know? You didn't even
know he had a second cell phone.

286
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,476
Hank, you have to question
this drug-dealer person.

287
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,193
He may know something.

288
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,029
Well, I'm telling you,
we're grasping at straws here.

289
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,868
Then grasp.

290
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,912
Excuse me, ma'am.

291
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,832
Hi, I'm looking for Jesse.
He around?

292
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,312
No. I'm afraid not.

293
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,318
-Why?
-I'm sorry. Hank Schrader.

294
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,752
I'm actually hoping to talk to Jesse
about my brother-in-law, Walter White.

295
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,032
He taught your son chemistry
in high school.

296
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:50,437
Oh, Mr. White.
Yes, I remember him.

297
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,154
-That was a long time ago.
-Yes, ma'am.

298
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,875
It's my understanding that he
and Jesse, they've stayed in touch.

299
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,870
-Really?
-Yeah.

300
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:05,233
Mr. White must've seen
some potential in Jesse.

301
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,670
He really tried to motivate him.

302
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,155
He was one of the few teachers
who cared.

303
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,078
Yeah, Walt's that way.
He's a good man.

304
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,717
I'm so sorry
to hear about his illness.

305
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,478
Please pass along our best wishes.

306
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,877
I certainly will,
as soon as he turns up.

307
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,229
He's missing, actually.

308
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,593
Just kind of walked off, or....

309
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,956
Anyway, which is why
I'm going around...

310
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,674
...trying to think of anyone
who knows him, even slightly.

311
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,518
That's terrible.

312
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,915
Anything we can do to help.

313
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,953
Well, if you could put me in touch
with your son....

314
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,072
Like I said,
we're kind of desperate for leads.

315
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,159
Jesse's not answering either number,
and no one seems to be at his house.

316
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,319
And why do you think my son
and Mr. White would be in touch?

317
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,318
I don't necessarily. I just--

318
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,636
-Are you with the police?
-No, ma'am. Not at all.

319
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,713
I'm with
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

320
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,394
Oh, my God.

321
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,635
Is my son in trouble?

322
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,195
I have absolutely no reason
to think that, no.

323
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,789
Do I need to get a lawyer?

324
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,468
You know, you don't seem
very forthright about this...

325
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,989
...coming here and asking questions
about my son and--

326
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,509
Mrs. Pinkman,
I'm not here on official capacity.

327
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,235
I do not care what your son may
or may not have done wrong.

328
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,112
I just wanna find my brother-in-law.

329
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,153
His wife is worried sick,
and she's got a baby on the way.

330
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,034
I'm sorry. I would like to help you...

331
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,629
...but I have not seen my son
in over a month.

332
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,071
I don't expect to see him
anytime soon.

333
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,796
Well, thanks for your time.

334
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,796
If you could tell me one more thing.

335
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,198
Is Jesse still driving the '89 Chevy
Monte Carlo, as far as you know?

336
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,591
If he had spent half as much time
and money on his education...

337
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,839
...as he has
on that ridiculous bouncing car....

338
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,077
Low rider, huh?

339
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,753
Gomey, hey.

340
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,679
No, nothing yet. Hey, listen,
do me a solid and check out...

341
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,871
...a '89 Chevy Monte Carlo...

342
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,312
...registered to a one
Jesse Pinkman.

343
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,512
Specifically, I wanna know
if the car's got a LoJack.

344
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,110
It's one of those jack-off low riders,
so I'm betting there is.

345
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,517
If so, can you go ahead
and get me a fix on it? Thanks, buddy.

346
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,271
Chilli powder.

347
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,150
Did I not already tell you
how moronic that was?

348
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,634
Whatever, man.

349
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,512
At least I tried something.

350
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,551
Hey, it almost worked too.

351
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,718
How's about
you leaving my gun, huh?

352
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,639
First you boost it,
then you leave it in your house.

353
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,432
My gun.

354
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,998
How was I supposed to know you were
chauffeuring Tuco to my doorstep?

355
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,237
Well, at least he wants you alive.

356
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,588
Hey, I don't get it.

357
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,678
If Tuco didn't kill Gonzo,
then who did?

358
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,518
I don't know.

359
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,957
I don't know.

360
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,118
Does it really matter?

361
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,108
If he finds out that Gonzo is dead
and not a police informant...

362
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,311
...who does he
automatically blame?

363
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,272
Us.

364
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,478
We need a plan.

365
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,751
-Think, think.
-Let's just bum-rush him, man.

366
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,110
You crack him over
the head with something...

367
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,276
...and I'll go for his gun.

368
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,558
Crack him over the head
with something?

369
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,194
Hey, you got the C-bomb, man,
all right?

370
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,992
You're as good
as checked out already.

371
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,113
Okay? You should be, like, all
sacrificial, jumping on a grenade, yo.

372
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,673
Just....

373
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,594
Oh, so my life
is not the priority here...

374
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,234
...because I'm gonna be
dead soon anyway.

375
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,158
That's your point?

376
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,279
Yeah.

377
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,718
We gotta get him to take this.

378
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,195
Well, he don't much like
the taste of chilli P.

379
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,152
That much has been established.

380
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,193
So unless you can convince him
to booty bump....

381
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,796
Eat. We got a long ride ahead of us.

382
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,754
Go on, sit. You're looking
a little weak, Heisenberg.

383
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,077
I don't want you to go belly up
before we get there.

384
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,718
Take it easy, <i>Tio.</i>

385
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,028
I will feed you.
I eat first. That's the deal.

386
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,312
What?

387
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,591
I get it, I get it, I get it.

388
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,839
Oh, you greedy old bastard.

389
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,156
I tell you, Heisenberg.

390
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,188
Old people.

391
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,912
You feed them, huh?

392
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,634
You put them in a really nice crib
in the country...

393
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,071
...and yet they gotta steal
the food off your plate.

394
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,398
You better eat every bite of that.

395
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,309
What did you do that for?

396
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,351
God!

397
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,035
Hey, look. Look.

398
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,798
There's nothing left.

399
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,630
What? What do you want?

400
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,999
No.

401
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,317
Don't even tell me
that you're hungry.

402
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,714
Don't go there.

403
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,397
Are you mad-dogging them, <i>Tio?</i>

404
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,113
What, you don't like them?

405
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,309
One ding.

406
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,751
That means yes<i>. Tio</i> don't like you.

407
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,554
Why don't you like them, <i>Tio?</i>

408
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,671
You don't trust them?

409
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,188
-Why don't you trust them, <i>Tio?</i>
-Tuco, come on. He's....

410
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,195
There clearly some dementia.
He's not lucid.

411
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,758
Did they do something to you, <i>Tio?</i>

412
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,992
Something that you don't like?

413
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,588
What did they do to you?
What did you do to my <i>tio?</i>

414
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,028
Nothing. Nothing.

415
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,836
-Bullshit! My <i>tio</i> does not lie!
-I don't know. I swear. I don't know.

416
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,636
No, I-- Maybe it was-- I did change
the channel on his TV, but....

417
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,990
Yeah, that's it.
While you were cooking...

418
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,556
...he was watching
one of those telenovels...

419
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,274
...with all those ripe honeys on it.
He was really into it.

420
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,072
I told you
not to change the channel.

421
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,158
You know, dude needs his eye candy.
That's it.

422
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,396
Is that it, <i>Tio?</i>

423
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,916
Is that it, <i>Tio?</i>

424
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,913
Did they change your mamitas?

425
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,756
What are you telling me, <i>Tio?</i>

426
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,668
Are they punking me?

427
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,755
Hey. No.

428
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,236
No, man. No.

429
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,839
-Come here!
-No.

430
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,430
No, no, Tuco.

431
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,878
Tuco, no. Tuco.

432
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,798
Shut up!

433
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:44,114
No. Please, no. God. Please, no.

434
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,709
No, God. I don't wanna die.

435
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,797
Tell me what you did, Walter!

436
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,151
Jesus, I don't wanna die.

437
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,957
-No!
-Tell me what you did!

438
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,710
We tried to poison you.

439
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,276
We tried to poison you...

440
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,959
...because you're an insane,
degenerate piece of filth...

441
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,037
...and you deserve to die.

442
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,036
Who's the bitch now?

443
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,591
Let him bleed.

444
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,352
The keys.

445
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,833
Tuco.

446
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,192
Oh, my God.

447
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,513
The cousins?

448
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,348
What the hell is going on?

449
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,477
Jesse Pinkman.

450
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,316
You're a hard man to find.

451
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,310
Oh, shit.

452
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,758
Easy.

453
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,510
Oh, my God.

454
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,437
Oh, God. Hank.

455
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,993
-Who?
-Hank.

456
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,519
What?

457
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,358
-Oh, my God.
-What?

458
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:50,597
-Oh, my God.
-Stay. What are you doing?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

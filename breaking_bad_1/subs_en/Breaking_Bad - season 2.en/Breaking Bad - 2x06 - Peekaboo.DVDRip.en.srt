1
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,554
-Yo.
-Yo.

2
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,954
What up?

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,229
Damn, bitch.

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,509
-You got something for me?
-Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,316
-Is this a five or an S?
-Five, yo.

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,317
No, wait. S.

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,229
-No, no. Yeah, five.
-Yeah?

8
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,195
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,389
Hey, man.

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,512
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,359
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,993
Hey.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,838
So they got names?

14
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,113
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

15
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,117
Him, they call Spooge.

16
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,319
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

17
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,351
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,437
...by a guy named Spooge?

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,198
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,836
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,554
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing....

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,830
-Did I say that?
-Because I'll go do it myself.

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,158
-It's just I'm on probation and all.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,911
So you gonna do it?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,319
Yeah.

26
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,670
Good. Right on.

27
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,839
Because these two,
they need to get got.

28
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,397
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

29
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,397
Where's my--?

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,230
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,432
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,153
Where's my money?

33
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,669
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,916
Come on.

35
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,479
I will mess you up.

36
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,513
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,154
Your funeral, jack.

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,912
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,793
Yeah, <i>mucho loco.</i>

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,992
Do not test me.

41
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,639
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,479
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,829
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,508
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,632
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,799
-You have a great day.
-Right on. You too.

47
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,712
God. Shit.

48
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,431
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,029
Hello?

50
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,871
<i>Tonight, you will receive</i>
<i>the ultimate mixture of cutlery...</i>

51
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,230
<i>...tonight in the steel knock out.</i>

52
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,238
<i>Every phone line jammed.</i>
<i>Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

53
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,670
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>

54
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,758
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only--</i>

55
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,599
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,268
<i>Now, Terry put this one together--</i>

57
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,948
Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,991
<i>--and I'm here to tell you--</i>

59
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,149
<i>Yeah, guys,</i>
<i>you might wanna put up like a....</i>

60
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,114
<i>Already done it.</i>

61
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,356
<i>Tonight, folks....</i>

62
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,277
<i>Do you realise how long it's been...</i>

63
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,871
<i>...since we've offered this sword</i>
<i>in this set?</i>

64
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,155
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto</i>
<i>as a bonus in the deal.</i>

65
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,952
<i>It's no wonder--</i>

66
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,118
<i>It is no wonder so many of you</i>
<i>are on the line right now--</i>

67
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,389
What's your name?

68
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,751
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.</i>
<i>Even though there are three, I'm--</i>

69
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,270
My name's Diesel.

70
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,357
<i>--eleven, 12, 13--</i>

71
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,518
<i>--sixteen, 17, 18, 19....</i>

72
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,154
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,830
Like, I don't know, <i>Mister Rogers'?</i>

74
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,033
<i>Imagine this plan,</i>
<i>this set in your own home.</i>

75
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,073
<i>Folks, custom pieces--</i>

76
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,319
<i>Well, needless to say,</i>
<i>I've made a pretty good mess...</i>

77
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,670
<i>...but there's a reason for that.</i>

78
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,908
<i>Just because these are under $10,</i>
<i>don't let anybody kid you.</i>

79
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,590
<i>These knives possess edges like....</i>

80
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,152
So when are your folks
coming home?

81
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,558
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,190
I'm hungry.

83
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,078
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

84
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,953
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt</i>
<i>a good first day back.</i>

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,915
<i>We'll be thinking about you</i>
<i>teaching valences and covalences....</i>

86
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,112
<i>Okay, that's all I officially</i>
<i>remembered. Good luck.</i>

87
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,039
<i>Skyler, give me a call</i>
<i>when you get a chance.</i>

88
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,833
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.</i>
<i>This is Gretchen Schwartz...</i>

89
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,996
<i>...calling to say hello.</i>

90
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,192
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today</i>
<i>and I was thinking about you both...</i>

91
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,594
<i>...hoping everything's well.</i>

92
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,758
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said</i>
<i>the number had been disconnected...</i>

93
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,349
<i>...so I'm just hoping</i>
<i>that everything's okay.</i>

94
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,630
<i>Call me if you can,</i>
<i>whenever's convenient.</i>

95
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,276
-Hello?
<i>-Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

96
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,790
<i>This is Skyler White.</i>
<i>Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

97
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,036
No. No, not at all.

98
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,595
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,119
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

100
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,635
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

101
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,037
<i>...and he lost his cell phone</i>
<i>quite a while back.</i>

102
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,037
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

103
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,073
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,599
That's wonderful.

105
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,430
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

106
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,394
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,750
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant...</i>

108
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,475
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and....

109
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,353
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just--

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,756
-What? What is it?
<i>-I can't...</i>

111
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,316
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,598
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,</i>
<i>it's just....</i>

113
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,271
It saved us.

114
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,150
I don't know if I....

115
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,999
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,316
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,830
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,600
So I just...

119
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,873
...finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,633
<i>Anyway....</i>

121
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,155
End of speech.

122
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,920
So I do--
I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,796
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:12,639
-How about this afternoon?
<i>-Yeah, okay.</i>

125
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,671
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

126
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,316
...trienes, polyenes.

127
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,830
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,996
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

129
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,350
...and you will...

130
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,519
...just keep in mind
that one element...

131
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,870
...carbon.

132
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,436
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

133
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,235
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,829
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

135
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,673
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

136
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,395
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,358
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,437
No. Okay.

139
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,910
I like to think of it....

140
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,230
I like to think that the diamond...

141
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,396
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

142
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,672
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

143
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,590
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,990
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,749
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,828
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,754
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

148
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,269
..for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,550
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

150
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,709
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

151
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,436
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

152
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,076
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,035
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:11,152
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,428
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,038
Anyway....

157
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,196
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

158
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,879
...paid to a carbon-based man....

159
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,518
...for something
he made out of carbon.

160
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,072
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

161
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,954
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,472
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,797
-And then there's the hair thing.
-I actually like that.

164
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,195
That's a great look for you.

165
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,311
-But you're feeling good?
-Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,590
It's....

167
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,199
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,076
I'm glad to.... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,191
We're happy too.

170
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,915
And I just....

171
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,838
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

172
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,596
Is everything okay?

173
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,714
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

174
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,471
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

175
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,478
You know, completely confidential.

176
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,511
Okay?

177
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,471
-See you tomorrow, Flynn.
-See you, Jeffrey.

178
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,075
Oh, man.

179
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,912
Let me see it.

180
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,790
-Dad, let me see it.
-Don't worry about it.

181
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,078
Hey, let's go.

182
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,671
<i>Forty-eight dollars,</i>
<i>that's the original price....</i>

183
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,869
Hey.

184
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,828
Peekaboo.

185
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,155
No?

186
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,313
Peekaboo.

187
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,668
Oh, man.

188
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,632
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,514
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,959
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

191
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,913
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

192
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,790
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,149
-Shut up!
-You shut up.

194
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,669
-You shut up, you--
-You shut up!

195
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,474
-You're the one who dropped it.
-I didn't drop it.

196
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,635
I didn't drop--

197
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,956
-Shit! You dropped it.
-Shut the hell up about it.

198
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,479
-You shut up!
-You shut up.

199
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,919
Get up.

200
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,349
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:45,032
-You know who might have done it?
-I have an idea.

202
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,190
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,678
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

204
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,829
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

205
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:05,194
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,715
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,592
You with me?

208
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,510
Scorpions?

209
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,474
Scorpions are good.

210
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,677
Yeah.

211
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,194
Nice.

212
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,154
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

213
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,828
Who is this?

214
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,833
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,076
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

216
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,555
-Mom.
-What? I'm just offering the choice.

217
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,149
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

218
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,193
-Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
-Nice to meet you too.

219
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,515
Oh, Walt.

220
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,992
Look who's here.

221
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,155
-Gretchen.
-Hi.

222
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,272
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

223
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,914
Look at you. You're looking good.

224
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,031
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

225
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,673
I know it was for me.

226
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,316
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

227
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,839
-May I?
-Oh, sure.

228
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,112
-For good luck, right?
-Exactly. Here's hoping.

229
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,878
-We could use some of that.
-Yeah.

230
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,153
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,916
-It was a really good thing.
-You're very welcome.

232
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,112
-We're gonna find a way to repay you.
-No, no, no.

233
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,312
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,473
You know, I hate to say it...

235
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,672
...but I really need to get going.

236
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,438
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,596
-You can't stay for dinner?
-I wish I could...

238
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,997
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

239
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,155
Okay. Okay.

240
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,956
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

241
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,388
Yeah, hopefully.

242
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,319
Gretchen, your purse.

243
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,228
Well, good to see you.

244
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,993
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

245
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,310
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

246
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,556
-It's so good to see you.
-And you.

247
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,514
-Nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

248
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,429
-Okay. Bye, now.
-Drive safely.

249
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,872
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

250
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,832
I'll be right back.

251
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,118
Gretchen.

252
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,035
Hey.

253
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,268
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

254
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,232
What did you...?

255
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,432
We need to talk.

256
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,519
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

257
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,598
Please. Please.

258
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,677
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

259
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,839
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

260
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,237
-I just wanna say, man--
-What? What do you wanna say?

261
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,873
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,311
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,715
-Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
-Shut up!

264
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,638
Jesus.

265
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,037
-Serious, I might have a concussion.
-Don't fall asleep, baby.

266
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,071
-Subdural hematoma.
-Don't fall asleep.

267
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,714
Shut up.

268
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,953
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,435
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

270
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,789
Do it!

271
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,039
All right, turn around.

272
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,434
Turn around.

273
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,115
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

274
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,509
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,351
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any--

276
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,152
-We shot it all.
-Yeah?

277
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,513
-Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
-Yeah.

278
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,756
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,589
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

280
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,588
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

281
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,631
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,638
There you go.

283
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,630
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,671
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,869
Division of labour.

286
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,029
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,231
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,749
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,757
-You shut up.
-You shut up, skank.

290
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,679
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,391
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

292
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,956
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,197
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

294
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,073
...for being such a pussy.

295
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,790
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,709
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,392
All right.

298
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,876
You two are never
getting high again.

299
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,548
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,320
Not another needle,
not another ball...

301
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,399
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

302
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,477
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

303
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,717
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,353
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,949
-Where?
-Back yard.

306
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,674
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

307
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,917
-Hurting. Painful.
-Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,669
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,758
Hey, don't move.

310
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,592
Come on.

311
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,114
See?

312
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,437
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,359
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,278
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,313
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,715
Get high.

317
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,353
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,676
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,269
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,949
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

321
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,355
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

322
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,949
<i>In, out, like, bam.</i>
<i>Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

323
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,318
<i>What, nobody saw you?</i>
<i>What about witnesses, dumbass?</i>

324
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,590
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

325
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,030
<i>All we did,</i>
<i>we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

326
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,390
<i>-Nobody even noticed.</i>
<i>-Nobody noticed?</i>

327
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,071
<i>-For real?</i>
<i>-I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

328
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,797
Oh, my God.

329
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,709
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,230
-It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
-You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,749
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,030
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,117
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,038
At least I got persistence.

335
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,993
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

336
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,557
-Don't listen to that skank.
-Stop calling me that.

337
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,759
I ain't no skank!

338
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,190
-Skank, skank, skank--
-Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,833
Sit, sit.

340
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:27,953
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,637
Now, chill.

342
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,998
You, get that thing open.

343
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,193
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,391
Where's the kid?

345
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,319
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,353
What are you asking me for?

347
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,396
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,794
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,548
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,276
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,914
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,680
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,279
Are you serious?

354
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,472
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,999
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, Diesel...

356
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,953
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

357
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,393
Get out of the way.

358
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,110
Get out of the way!

359
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,639
So you didn't tell anyone.

360
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,071
-You didn't tell Elliott.
-Not yet.

361
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,355
-Well, what does that mean?
-That means exactly what it means.

362
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,711
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,477
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,749
All right.

365
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,034
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

366
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,117
This was....

367
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,995
This entire thing was unfortunate.

368
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,350
Unfortunate?

369
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,717
And I apologise deeply.

370
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,759
Thank you.

371
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,391
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,755
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,834
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,957
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

375
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,559
...how are you paying for it?

376
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,311
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

377
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,559
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,354
You tell your wife and son...

379
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,676
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,394
Why are you doing this?

381
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,873
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,152
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

383
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,918
...thanking me for saving your life.

384
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,033
-Why would you do that to her?
-As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,756
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

386
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,915
All right?

387
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,634
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

388
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,195
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

389
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,230
I don't owe you an explanation.

390
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,910
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologised.

391
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,793
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

392
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,833
There. I've apologised twice now.

393
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,793
I'm humbly sorry.

394
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,399
Three times.

395
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,477
Let me just get this straight.

396
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,955
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

397
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,559
...no strings attached.

398
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,876
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

399
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

400
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,072
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

401
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,032
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

402
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,151
...you involve us in your lie.

403
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:22,992
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,708
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,395
What happened to you?

406
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,196
Really, Walt.

407
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,118
What happened?

408
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,993
Because this isn't you.

409
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,629
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

410
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:54,072
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

411
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,510
That I should go begging
for your charity?

412
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,397
And you waving
your chequebook around...

413
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,990
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

414
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,269
...how you and Elliott--

415
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,438
How you and Elliott cut me out?

416
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,358
What? That can't be how you see it.

417
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,870
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

418
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,911
That cannot be how you see it.

419
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,951
-Good. That's beautifully done.
-You left--

420
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,878
You are always
the picture of innocence.

421
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,514
-You left me.
-The picture of innocence.

422
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,110
-Just sweetness and light.
-You left me.

423
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,108
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

424
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,312
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

425
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,988
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

426
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,760
What? Did I dream all of that?

427
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,349
That's your excuse...

428
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,233
...to build your little empire
on my work?

429
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,590
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

430
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,712
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

431
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,514
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

432
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,196
I don't even know what to say to you.

433
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,792
I don't even know where to begin.

434
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,000
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,914
Fuck you.

436
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,911
Hey.

437
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,230
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,959
Hey.

439
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,593
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,349
No, what are you doing?

441
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,591
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,392
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,990
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,031
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,795
Bedtime.

446
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,834
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,159
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,157
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,920
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,634
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,308
Oh, hey.

452
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,829
Should I ask where you've been?

453
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,558
Never mind.

454
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,638
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,432
Skyler.

456
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,596
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,192
Walt.

458
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,235
We need to talk.

459
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,317
Just say it.

460
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,473
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,593
What did she say, exactly?

462
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,635
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:15,515
She said something like:

464
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,714
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

465
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,311
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,478
I wish you the very best."

467
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,355
And that was it.

468
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,313
Yeah.

469
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,033
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,071
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,669
I was so stunned, but....

472
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,590
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

473
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,348
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,789
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

475
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,470
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

476
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,831
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,392
Walt.

478
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,996
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,035
Where were you tonight?

480
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,353
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,114
I was with Gretchen.

482
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,437
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,951
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

484
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,913
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,112
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

486
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,117
...and beating around the bush--

487
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,029
Okay, what--? Tell us what?

488
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,392
Well....

489
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,269
There was a lot of...

490
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,795
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

491
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,313
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

492
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,397
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,752
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion....

494
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,999
They're broke.

495
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,433
-You are kidding me.
-No.

496
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,873
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,517
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and....

498
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,280
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

499
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,155
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

500
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,072
That is--

501
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,796
Jesus, that's....

502
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,348
Yeah.

503
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,030
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,988
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,078
Listen.

506
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,636
Not to sound selfish...

507
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,715
...but as far as we go...

508
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,230
...we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:39,915
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,549
Hey.

511
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,991
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

512
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,077
Okay.

513
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,151
And yet...

514
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,318
...she still drives a Bentley.

515
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,239
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,953
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,709
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,593
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,199
Nowhere.

520
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,198
I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,391
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,636
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

523
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,356
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

524
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,755
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,838
I need to.... I need to even out.

526
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,112
-Let me get a hit of that crystal.
-Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,548
Come on, baby.

528
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,638
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:09,594
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,552
I ain't no skank.

531
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,955
I would appreciate an apology.

532
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,509
What?

533
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,314
I am trying to take
the high road here.

534
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,794
Are you gonna do right?

535
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,035
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,596
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,395
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

538
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,956
...and assist me and shut up.

539
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,356
I ain't no skank.

540
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,437
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

541
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,958
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

542
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,874
You listening to me, skank?

543
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,668
You hear me, skank?

544
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,793
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

545
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,709
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

546
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,957
I ain't no skank.

547
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,629
No, no, no. Don't. No.

548
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,959
I ain't no skank.

549
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,509
<i>911.</i>

550
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,634
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

551
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,912
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,714
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,036
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,550
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

555
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,311
Here you go.

556
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,957
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

557
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,630
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and....

558
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,429
Look, just....
Just don't go back inside. All right?

559
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,438
You stay right here. Okay?

560
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:29,510
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.

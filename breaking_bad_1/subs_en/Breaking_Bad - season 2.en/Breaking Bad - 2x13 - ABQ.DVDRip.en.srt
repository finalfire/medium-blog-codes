1
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,431
Come on.

2
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,558
Come on.

3
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,712
Come....

4
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,639
Come on. Come on, baby.

5
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,070
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

6
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,355
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

7
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,913
Yeah.

8
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,873
Slow down. Slow-- Slow down.

9
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,992
And just-- Just take a deep breath.

10
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,753
Do it.

11
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,919
All right.

12
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,552
Now, what happened?

13
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,469
All right. All right. Now...

14
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,598
...listen-- Listen to me.
Are you listening?

15
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,153
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

16
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,316
No, no-- Listen. Calm down.

17
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,953
Just....

18
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,190
Sit tight. I know who to call.

19
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,555
Saul Goodman sent me.

20
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,434
Come on. Inside.

21
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,278
Watch the door.

22
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,912
Where is she?

23
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,075
Any other drugs in the house?

24
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,676
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

25
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,551
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

26
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,473
Here's your story.

27
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,070
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

28
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,079
Say it.

29
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,438
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

30
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,194
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,197
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

32
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,675
Again.

33
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,397
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

34
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,113
Again. Again.

35
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,153
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

36
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,591
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,598
Once you call,
the people who show up...

38
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,268
...will be with
the Office of Medical Investigations.

39
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,755
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

40
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,155
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

41
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,351
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

42
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,949
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

43
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,318
There's nothing to incriminate you...

44
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,750
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

45
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,151
However, if you do, you say nothing.

46
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,396
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

47
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,716
Then you call Saul Goodman.

48
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,194
And do I need to state the obvious?

49
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,149
I was not here.

50
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,513
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

51
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,551
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

52
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,591
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

53
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,756
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

54
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,314
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

55
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,229
-Two.
-Two. All right.

56
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,439
Thank you.

57
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,678
Junior.

58
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,592
Junior.

59
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,469
-Flynn.
-What?

60
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,999
Flynn.

61
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,798
Flynn.

62
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,395
I'll be there in a minute.

63
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,958
You all right?

64
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,997
Flynn, get your butt in here.

65
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,871
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

66
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,991
Seriously.

67
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,077
-What?
-Look right there. Look at that.

68
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,555
Are those donations?

69
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,352
-Yes.
-Actual donations for your dad?

70
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,831
Total strangers gave us $490.

71
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,670
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

72
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,190
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

73
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,632
And it's all real, actual money.

74
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,795
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

75
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,713
And look what they're saying.

76
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,038
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

77
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,036
Isn't this awesome?

78
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,272
That's-- Wow, that is something.

79
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,759
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

80
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,877
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

81
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,152
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

82
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,434
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

83
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:50,430
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

84
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,597
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you.:</i>

85
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,755
<i>"Do-not-call list."</i>

86
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,633
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

87
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,354
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

88
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,516
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

89
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,078
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

90
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,470
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

91
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,396
I just woke up and I found her.

92
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,352
That's all I know.

93
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,757
What's her date of birth?

94
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,190
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

95
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,519
April....

96
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,429
-April 4th, 1982.
-Okay.

97
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,112
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

98
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,519
-My mother?
-Your daughter's mother.

99
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,233
Bishop.

100
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,037
-And place of birth?
-Phoenix.

101
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,874
Phoenix, Arizona?

102
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,555
This is our address.

103
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,918
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

104
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,473
I can drive.

105
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,557
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

106
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,069
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

107
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,475
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

108
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,954
Okay?

109
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,550
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

110
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,990
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

111
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,111
-Forty from Te--
-Terre Haute.

112
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,275
Walt.

113
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,315
<i>It's me.</i>

114
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,556
<i>Are you there? Hello.</i>

115
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,837
I'm just checking in.

116
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,188
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

117
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,630
That's-- That's good.

118
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,833
So listen. Just call me, all right?

119
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,795
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

120
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,473
All right. I'm coming.

121
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,718
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

122
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,753
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

123
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,033
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

124
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,233
Biggest donation...

125
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,159
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

126
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,757
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

127
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,712
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

128
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,912
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

129
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,109
...here's what we know.

130
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,595
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

131
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,268
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

132
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,038
"Combo?" I hear you say.

133
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,030
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

134
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,754
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

135
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,394
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

136
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,068
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

137
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,068
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

138
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,038
So why am I talking about him?

139
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,520
Anyone? Anyone?

140
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,675
Bueller?

141
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,997
-He was dealing Blue Sky.
-That's right.

142
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,873
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

143
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,517
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

144
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,119
But wait. It gets better.

145
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,312
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

146
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,476
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

147
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,478
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

148
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,832
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

149
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,995
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

150
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,509
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

151
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,192
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

152
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,311
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

153
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,034
-He copped to it, didn't he?
-For an extra pudding cup...

154
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,514
...every night at Los Lunas?

155
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,711
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

156
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,037
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

157
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,468
I've been thinking.

158
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,992
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

159
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,031
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

160
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,800
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

161
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,231
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

162
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,469
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

163
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,114
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

164
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,198
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

165
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,359
In fact, everywhere but here.

166
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,271
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

167
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,719
Now...

168
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,994
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

169
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,029
I say he's gone regional.

170
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,356
Only he's still right here in town.

171
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,113
Come on, 2800.

172
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,471
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

173
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,194
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

174
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,873
Fo-- Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

175
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,479
-Yes!
-Yes!

176
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,075
Who's gonna be next?

177
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,998
Your guy found him?

178
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,152
Where is he?

179
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,315
Okay, listen.

180
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,953
No, no, I don't care.

181
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,718
You have your guy pick--

182
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,831
Saul. Just shut-- Saul.

183
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,191
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

184
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,793
I don't recommend it.

185
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,997
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

186
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,760
..keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

187
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,759
Are they here now?

188
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,669
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

189
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,836
Police could be the least of it.

190
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,917
You could just get mugged or shot.

191
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,078
How about you go on home, Walter?

192
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,191
Let me handle this.

193
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,153
Yo.

194
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,598
Jesse.

195
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,429
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

196
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,438
-Wake up. Wake up.
-Hey.

197
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,155
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

198
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,271
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just--

199
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,597
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

200
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,869
Jesse.

201
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,640
-Yeah.
-Come on, let's get out of here.

202
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,310
No, no, no.

203
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,431
-I'm good.
-Come on. Help me out now.

204
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,837
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

205
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,077
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

206
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,350
You are not good at all. You hear?

207
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,077
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

208
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,599
You're gonna stand up...

209
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,155
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

210
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,316
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

211
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,637
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

212
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,351
I killed her.

213
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,472
-What?
-I killed her. It was me.

214
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,238
-I killed her, man. I killed her.
-No.

215
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,432
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

216
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,993
You didn't kill anybody.

217
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,515
I loved her.

218
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,594
I loved her more than anything.

219
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,157
No, no. No.

220
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,191
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

221
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,516
I guess they should be....

222
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,076
I don't know.
Just use your best judgement.

223
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,555
There's no yellow dress here.

224
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,230
It's all-- It's all black and grey.

225
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,719
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

226
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,396
What about blue?

227
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,751
Blue's better than black, right?

228
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,432
No, no. Not dark blue. More like....

229
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,474
Not super-bright, either.

230
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,272
I mean, blue is blue.

231
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,916
No. No cleavage.

232
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,071
Long sleeves.

233
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,353
Yeah. It's nice.

234
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,473
It's nice.

235
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,672
Big yawn, Holly.

236
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,758
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

237
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,633
-Okay, sweetie.
-Yes.

238
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,399
Yes!

239
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,955
Here we go.

240
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,630
Here we go. Yes.

241
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,671
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

242
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,430
Junior. Hey.

243
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,193
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

244
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,837
-Dad, it's money.
-Just please do it.

245
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:49,429
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

246
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,031
Marie, slow down. I can't--

247
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,998
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

248
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,552
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

249
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,389
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna-- Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

250
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,919
Okay.

251
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,118
-Guess what.
-What?

252
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,709
-You are gonna be in the newspaper.
-No way.

253
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,831
One of Marie's patients
works at the <i>Journal.</i>

254
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,235
She told him about the website
and the donations...

255
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,670
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

256
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,835
-For real?
-Yep.

257
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,918
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

258
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,633
Awesome.

259
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,231
-It'll mean more hits.
-And more contributions.

260
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,671
East of Scottsdale?

261
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:40,189
Let me guess. Not talking.

262
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,758
Nope. Not a one.

263
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,758
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

264
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,309
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

265
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,192
Yeah. You too.

266
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,638
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

267
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,910
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

268
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,513
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

269
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,629
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

270
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,512
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

271
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,711
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

272
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,672
-Hey, it's a pleasure.
-Good to meet you.

273
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,236
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

274
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,431
-Please, just Gus.
-Hi, Gus.

275
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,358
You guys make some killer chicken.

276
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,075
Thank you very much.

277
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,669
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

278
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,632
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

279
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,308
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

280
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,511
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

281
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,153
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

282
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,874
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

283
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,719
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

284
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,556
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

285
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,638
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

286
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,070
-Terrible.
-Yeah. It is indeed.

287
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,793
We've had
some successes locally...

288
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,991
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

289
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,636
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

290
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,910
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

291
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,269
Anything we can do.

292
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,833
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Hank.

293
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,109
-Gentlemen.
-Thanks.

294
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,912
Sure. Thank you.

295
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,478
Is this one of your agents?

296
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,468
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

297
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,557
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to--

298
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,036
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

299
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,669
-Lung cancer.
-Oh, that's a rough one.

300
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,395
-Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
-Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

301
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,038
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

302
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,436
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

303
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,073
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

304
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,869
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

305
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,673
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

306
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,952
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

307
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,954
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

308
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,199
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

309
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,116
I deserve this.

310
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,479
What?

311
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,153
What you said in the desert.

312
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,909
I get it, what you meant.

313
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,235
I deserve whatever happens.

314
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,711
Oh, shit.

315
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,192
There he is!

316
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,912
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

317
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,395
We called you about 50 times.

318
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,831
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

319
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,316
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the <i>Journal...</i>

320
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,910
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

321
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,468
-This is him?
-Yes.

322
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,999
This is Dad. Great.

323
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,317
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

324
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,351
...Mom and Dad on either side.

325
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,913
Mom and Dad?

326
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,553
How much money
have you raised so far?

327
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,629
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

328
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,796
But there's more coming in
all the time.

329
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,719
-Wow, that's amazing.
-We don't even know what to say.

330
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,230
It's just-- It's been incredible.

331
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,556
Judging from things you have
written about him...

332
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,232
-...your dad must be quite a guy.
-Yeah. He is. He's the best.

333
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,795
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

334
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,993
None of us do. We love him.

335
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,752
-He's a good man, isn't he?
-Absolutely. Ask anyone.

336
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,672
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

337
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,348
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

338
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,674
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

339
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,158
He's just decent.

340
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,670
And he always does the right thing.

341
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,190
And that's how he teaches me to be.

342
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,996
-Would you say he's your hero?
-Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

343
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,714
My dad is my hero.

344
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,358
Does that put him to sleep?

345
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,912
This one just relaxes him a little.

346
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,759
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

347
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,518
Okay. Thank you.

348
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,474
Well....

349
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,397
-Here we are.
-Yeah.

350
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,598
Relaxed yet?

351
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,836
As a matter of fact....

352
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,230
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

353
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,559
Yeah, it looks like it.

354
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,271
We'll be here when you wake up.

355
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,760
Well, I'll be looking for you.

356
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,520
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

357
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,358
Yeah, you better.

358
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,709
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

359
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,117
Where's your phone?

360
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,436
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

361
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,278
Which one?

362
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,634
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

363
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,439
Okay.

364
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,919
Well, first things first.

365
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,350
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

366
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,393
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but....

367
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,716
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

368
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,875
-Seven, right?
-Yeah.

369
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,392
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

370
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,352
...here somewhere.

371
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,035
-She's beautiful.
-Thanks.

372
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,834
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

373
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,636
-How's your pain level, Walter?
-It's....

374
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,751
Very low, basically.

375
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,757
Shortness of breath?

376
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,599
-A bit, but much better.
-Good.

377
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,392
Well, your margins look good.

378
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,033
I can't foresee the future...

379
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,958
...but even
conservatively speaking...

380
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,674
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

381
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,109
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

382
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,038
That's great.

383
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,677
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

384
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,276
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

385
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,710
-He can ease into it now.
-Okay.

386
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:01,119
-And can he go back to work or...?
-I'd give it a few more weeks.

387
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,315
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

388
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,988
But he can be on his own?

389
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,317
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

390
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,194
Yes. Use your best judgement.

391
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,228
Well....

392
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,908
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

393
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,315
One less baby in the house.

394
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,310
-Don, hey.
-Hey, Stew.

395
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,875
Hey, welcome back.

396
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,957
Thanks. It's good to be back.

397
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,278
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

398
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,110
Yes. Thanks.

399
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,431
Terrible thing. Just....

400
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:54,197
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and....

401
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
-You been doing okay?
-I'm doing okay.

402
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,716
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

403
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,310
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

404
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,628
-Focus on work.
-Sure. Absolutely.

405
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,514
Yeah.

406
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,389
Well, see you inside.

407
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,190
Continue to descend through 1500.

408
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,278
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

409
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,075
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

410
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,875
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

411
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,756
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

412
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,316
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

413
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,953
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

414
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,628
I think I may just keep this.

415
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,869
Sky?

416
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,913
What do you think?

417
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,636
Doesn't look so bad, right?

418
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,989
What are you doing?

419
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,634
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

420
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,557
-Since when?
-I'm taking the baby with me.

421
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,591
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

422
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:08,073
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

423
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:11,114
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

424
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,234
Why would I do that?

425
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,477
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

426
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,035
-Skyler.
-I want you gone by Monday morning.

427
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,593
I want--

428
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,149
I want you gone.

429
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,314
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

430
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,510
Because you're a liar, Walt.

431
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,192
Two cell phones, after all.

432
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,555
What?

433
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,593
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

434
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,509
...and you said, "Which one?"

435
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,869
When?

436
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,514
Skyler, I was medicated.

437
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,790
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

438
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,955
You know what I think?

439
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,837
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

440
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,794
Honey, we have been over this.

441
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,877
Asked and answered, right?

442
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,878
Then it got me thinking again...

443
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,516
...about all the strange behaviour.

444
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,075
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

445
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,635
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

446
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,671
...checking the morgue.

447
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,550
Your fugue state?

448
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,508
I had to believe that, didn't I?

449
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,355
I had to find a way.

450
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,990
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

451
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,908
You tell me, Skyler.

452
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,078
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

453
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,313
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

454
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,636
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

455
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,400
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

456
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,875
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

457
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,235
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

458
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,830
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

459
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,758
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

460
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,872
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

461
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,715
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

462
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,751
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

463
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,033
So I finally left a message:

464
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:22,915
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

465
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,429
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

466
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,076
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

467
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,795
The money for your treatment...

468
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,794
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

469
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,072
They paid for nothing.

470
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,589
You refused every offer
they made you.

471
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,028
But that didn't make sense...

472
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,595
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

473
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,951
...and not including your surgery...

474
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,071
...we're nearly paid up.

475
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,994
Over $100,000.

476
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:01,598
Out of where? Out of thin air?

477
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,392
But then...

478
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,916
...I called your mother.

479
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,399
Yeah.

480
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,152
Thanks for that too.

481
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,030
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

482
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,153
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

483
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,277
It's possible.

484
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,638
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

485
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:42,675
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

486
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,995
You never went to see her.

487
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,591
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

488
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,153
You were gone for four days...

489
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,989
...and yet she swears...

490
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,715
...that you were never there.

491
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,432
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

492
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,235
Skyler.

493
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,998
Could you...

494
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,797
...just once...

495
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,109
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

496
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,433
Skyler.

497
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,632
Skyler, don't do this, please.

498
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,990
I....

499
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,994
Skyler, please don't go.

500
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,996
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

501
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,719
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

502
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,752
Whatever it is...

503
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:05,717
...I'm afraid to know.

504

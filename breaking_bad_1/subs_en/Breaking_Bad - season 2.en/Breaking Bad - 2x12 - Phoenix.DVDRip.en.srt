1
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,957
Skyler, I'm so....

2
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,789
Marie. Oh, Christ, Marie. How...?

3
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,352
Oh, God. Oh, thank God.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,718
Is she beautiful?

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,200
Yeah, I'm staring at brake lights
on the 40.

6
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,913
Some accident up ahead.

7
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,917
Christ! Today of all days, huh?

8
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,875
No, no, no. Let her rest.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

9
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,869
Thank you.

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,033
Excuse me. Skyler White?

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,595
-307.
-Thank you.

12
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,835
Skyler, I'm so sorry. I'm just....

13
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,632
Are you okay?

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,915
Meet your daughter.

15
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,835
Hi there, girl. Hi there, Holly.

16
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,917
Congratulations, Walt.

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,669
Oh, Ted, I'm sorry,
I didn't see you here.

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,348
Oh, Ted drove me here. Thank God.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,917
I mean, this little bundle of joy
of ours was practically on rails.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,554
Halfway here I thought
he was gonna have to pull over...

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,512
...and deliver her himself.

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,431
Well, that--
I'm glad it didn't come to that.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,429
Yeah. Thanks, Ted.

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,877
No problem at all.

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,755
Well, let me get out of your way here
so you two can--

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,793
You three can be alone, okay?

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,514
Listen, take it easy, Sky.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,237
-I really can't begin to thank you.
-Don't think anything of it.

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,317
It's my pleasure.
Congratulations again.

30
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,873
-Thank you.
-She's beautiful.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,513
Okay. I'll talk to you soon.

32
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,948
Okay. Take care.

33
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,354
Bye.

34
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,955
Are you okay?

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,912
-Is everything okay?
-Everything is okay.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,396
I just wish you'd been here.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,309
-Where's everyone else?
-Downstairs.

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,112
Hank and Marie
took Junior for dinner.

39
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,359
He has been such a trouper.
He even changed his first diaper.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,391
-No.
-Yeah.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,833
Did he?

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,549
Honey, is there anything
that I can do for you?

43
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,990
-Anything at all?
-Actually, yes.

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,668
I left my overnight bag
at home this morning.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,474
I just think you get it in your head,
C-section. You know?

46
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,309
But I'm just so glad,
the way it all worked out.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,754
Doing it natural instead.

48
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,110
It just couldn't have gone any better.

49
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,753
Good.

50
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,912
Let me go get your things.

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,309
And I'll get my stuff too, okay?

52
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,999
-I'll spend the night.
-Okay.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,399
Dad.

54
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,114
I was in the shower, hey.

55
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,071
I overslept.

56
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,869
I'm running late, but I'll be there.

57
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,553
Yeah.

58
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,632
Baby, I gotta go.

59
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,998
Okay.

60
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,678
Somebody broke in.

61
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,393
Okay.

62
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,596
Oh, no. No, no, no!

63
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,033
Come on.

64
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,038
Damn.

65
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,272
Oh, God.

66
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,437
Oh, Christ.

67
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,474
This week was tough.

68
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,033
Toughest yet.

69
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,277
You know why?
I knew this day was coming.

70
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,755
-My birthday.
-Your re-birthday?

71
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,871
Yeah. As it got closer, it got worse.

72
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,832
I was scared shitless
I wouldn't make it.

73
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,393
I really didn't think I would.

74
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,830
Called in sick three days in a row.

75
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,917
I know my boss was pissed.

76
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,998
I guess I don't really care.
I just didn't wanna see anybody.

77
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,269
You guys know how that is.

78
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,313
All it would take is one friend...

79
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
...and I'd be out
ripping and running again.

80
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,316
But I made it. I really made it.

81
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,353
I got one year clean to the day.

82
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,035
You look tired.
Your eyes are kind of red.

83
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,198
-You getting enough sleep?
-Actually, no.

84
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,757
I'm working on this
really complex new tat.

85
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,315
-Yeah?
-A guy wants his whole back done up.

86
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,988
Him on his chopper with, like,
flames all around.

87
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,510
I keep showing him the design,
he keeps asking for changes, like:

88
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,631
"Give me more muscles.
Give me more flames."

89
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,673
And I'm like, "A:
This ain't the Sistine Chapel.

90
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,919
And B: I have enough trouble
working around your zits."

91
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,470
I really wish you wouldn't
work at that place.

92
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,477
You need to avoid
those type of people.

93
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,513
I know and I do.

94
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,790
It's mostly college kids
and airmen from Kirtland.

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,752
It's actually really corporate.

96
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,713
Thank you.

97
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,278
So how's your job?

98
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,277
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

99
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,675
Doing backup training
on my days off.

100
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,509
God, they're hiring anybody now.
I mean, no experience at all. It's scary.

101
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,790
You seeing anyone?

102
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,319
No.

103
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,629
You?

104
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,316
What about that guy next door?

105
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,794
What do you mean?

106
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,230
Well, he seemed to have
some expectation...

107
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,953
...of you introducing me to him.

108
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,151
He knows you own the place.

109
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,919
Yeah.

110
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,389
Dad, he's our tenant.

111
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,348
End of story.

112
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,391
Why would I get involved
with a tenant?

113
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,389
Okay.

114
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,038
There you go.

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,913
Oh, yes.

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,111
Oh, isn't she beautiful?

117
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,709
I just think she's the most
beautiful baby ever.

118
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,195
Yeah. And why not?

119
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,072
Good stock.

120
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,359
I'll get it.

121
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,788
Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,673
Hello. Hello?

123
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,918
Nobody's there.

124
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,633
Oh, well.

125
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,278
Beat you.

126
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,718
-Hello.
-Hey, man.

127
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,319
<i>Oh, hi, Carmen.</i>

128
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,989
Just Carmen.

129
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,670
-Come on. Hurry up.
-So you heard, huh? Yes, yes.

130
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,155
<i>Good news.</i>
<i>Oh, she's just so beautiful.</i>

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,639
Well, Holly.

132
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,592
<i>Seven pounds, 3 ounces.</i>

133
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,234
Everybody is doing just fine.

134
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,079
You junkie imbecile.
What are you calling this number for?

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,316
I am trying to tell you, man.

136
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,318
Last night,
somebody broke in my place, yo.

137
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,919
-<i>I got robbed.</i>
-What?

138
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,432
Yeah. Somebody,
they got all of our stuff. Okay?

139
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,278
All of it.

140
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,310
You get me, Mr. White?

141
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,511
<i>The blue stuff. It's, like, uncanny.</i>

142
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,836
They knew exactly where to look.

143
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,511
I mean, say something, man, all right?
Yell at me or something! Come on!

144
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,912
<i>Mr. White.</i>

145
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,393
God!

146
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,952
Oh, no.

147
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,910
Okay. Okay. Okay.

148
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,840
Hank, come on.
People are starving to death out here.

149
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,996
All right. I just had to get a beer.

150
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,679
Finally.

151
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,393
All right, guys. Here we go.

152
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,229
We got mild, medium
and <i>muy caliente.</i>

153
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,557
I got dibs on the breast.

154
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,752
-Los Pollos Hermanos?
-Oh, yeah, seriously. You gotta try it.

155
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,111
I think this joint gives KFC
a run for their money.

156
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,272
That baby is hungry.

157
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,799
Give me that baby.

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,036
Oh, sweetie, yes.

159
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,798
Do you have any coleslaw in there?

160
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,558
Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Jeez, Sky.

161
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,870
-Not at the table. We're eating.
-Hank, it's only a breast.

162
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,038
-It's my sister-in-law's breast.
-Oh, you are so provincial.

163
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,552
Hank, remember the day...

164
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,955
...when you were talking to me
about childproofing?

165
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,149
Yeah.

166
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,715
Yeah, yeah. What are you thinking?
A fence or a cover?

167
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,515
Yeah. No, well, actually, I was
thinking more of an alarm system.

168
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,508
They've got these new systems that
are now sonar systems that would--

169
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,836
Anything falls into it,
it sets the alarm off.

170
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:57,995
Oh, nice.

171
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,919
-Wow, that sounds expensive.
-Well, yeah.

172
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,591
-But for the baby, I mean....
-Well, why don't....

173
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,636
Why don't you let Marie and I
get that for you?

174
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,149
-Absolutely.
-No, no. Thank you.

175
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,749
No, no, please.
I'll be back at work soon.

176
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,552
We'll take care of it.

177
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,557
Back at work soon?

178
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,197
Since you're scheduled
for surgery...

179
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,473
...I just thought it might be a good
idea to have some money coming in.

180
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,909
Well, Skyler, we need to think
about what's best for the baby.

181
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,033
And I think having her mother around
for at least the first few years....

182
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,079
Money-wise, we'll manage.
I promise you that.

183
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,750
What? You guys got, like, a printing
press in the garage churning out 50s?

184
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,949
I wish.

185
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,071
Mom's even talking
about me getting a job.

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,716
That's right. Everybody pitches in.

187
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,029
Why don't we ever get Chinese?

188
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,958
I'll get her.

189
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,118
I'll get her.

190
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,473
Yes. Good girl.

191
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,910
That's a good girl.

192
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,270
My little girl, huh?

193
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,070
Hey, do you wanna see something?

194
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,833
Come here.

195
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,715
Oh, I know, I know.

196
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,519
Yeah.

197
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,359
Hey.

198
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,033
You wanna see what
your daddy did for you?

199
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,872
Let me show you.

200
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,796
Here. Come here.

201
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,713
Wanna see?

202
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,279
That's right. Daddy did that.

203
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,270
Daddy did that for you.

204
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,678
This place looks exactly the same.

205
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:51,077
Why don't you have computers
and shit? It's the 20th century.

206
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,713
What the hell are you doing here?

207
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,831
-Get out.
-No. You took the stash.

208
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,917
I heard all those messages,
figured it out.

209
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,953
You figured it out, huh?
Well, congratulations, Einstein.

210
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,755
You left me to freak out all day long
like I dropped the ball or something...

211
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,350
-...and you were the one who took it!
-Shut up.

212
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,070
You lower your voice.

213
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,636
"Like you dropped the ball"?

214
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,435
When have you ever
not dropped the ball, Jesse?

215
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,029
Blasted out of your mind
on whatever the hell that was.

216
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,312
What was that, heroin?

217
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,235
Jesus.

218
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,995
I was on my day off, man.
What I do on my day off--

219
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,395
"Day off"?
We were on call, you junkie.

220
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,591
On call for the biggest deal
of our lives.

221
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,031
I just managed to pull it off by the
skin of my teeth, no thanks to you.

222
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,153
And you made me miss
the birth of my daughter.

223
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,714
Son of a bitch.

224
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,749
How much?

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,515
-How much what?
-How much did you get for the deal?

226
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,876
One-point-two million.

227
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,398
Six hundred thousand each.

228
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,318
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

229
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,955
Saul's cut is 20 percent.

230
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,677
All right.
So where's my money?

231
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,273
What?

232
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,190
You are joking, right?

233
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,110
If I gave you that money...

234
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,390
...you would be dead
inside of a week.

235
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,993
Man, look, I'm off the heroin.

236
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,431
I didn't even like it anyway.
It made me sick.

237
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,471
And the.... And the meth.

238
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,878
You know, I could take it or leave it.

239
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,548
I'm clean, Mr. White.

240
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,273
For real.

241
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,114
Prove it. Pee in that.

242
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,039
-How gay are you, seriously?
-Pee in it.

243
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,470
They're selling testing kits
at the drugstores.

244
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,877
If you are clean,
I will give you every last dime.

245
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,269
No, huh?

246
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,834
Well, I guess, until then
you'll just have to depend...

247
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,873
...on the kindness of strangers
to get high.

248
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,753
That and your little junkie girlfriend.

249
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,913
Not on her tummy, Walt.

250
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,759
I'm not putting her on her tummy.

251
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,474
I'll put her on her side.
Do you wanna hold her back?

252
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,352
-Yeah.
-Right there.

253
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,949
Just in case she decides
to do a little spit-up...

254
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,711
...I'm gonna roll up a nice clean towel
like this and put it under.

255
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,870
Hammacher Schlemmer
makes a proper one of those.

256
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,389
-It's hypoallergenic.
-Oh, yeah?

257
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,798
Well, I think a towel will do.

258
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,158
Skyler, what is it?

259
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,193
Your son. He is just unbelievable.
Come see what he did.

260
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,233
-I told you it's not ready yet.
-Honey, just show it to them.

261
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,309
My God, son. That's wonderful.

262
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,873
Flynn.

263
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,355
This is beautiful.

264
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,793
SaveWalterWhite.com.

265
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,074
Well, I, for one,
am telling everybody.

266
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,349
Wait a minute. You're not asking
for money, are you, son?

267
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,437
Yeah. That's the whole idea.

268
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,632
Louis helped me set up
a PayPal account and everything.

269
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,472
-See?
-But we can't ask for money.

270
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,474
Walt.

271
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,513
Okay.

272
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,592
I appreciate it. I really do.

273
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,196
Show me what else you put on.

274
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,074
This was all his idea.
He worked so hard on it.

275
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,191
-Just let him help.
-Skyler.

276
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,109
It's-- You can't ask him
to take it down.

277
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,074
-It'll crush him.
-Skyler, it's charity.

278
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,076
Why do you say that
like it's some sort of dirty word?

279
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,277
This is insane.

280
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,516
I have so much cash on hand...

281
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,473
...that I actually count it
by weighing it on my bathroom scale.

282
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,911
And yet, I can't spend it.
I can't tell my family about it.

283
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,839
All of whom think that I am
right on the edge of bankruptcy.

284
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,473
I mean, it's--

285
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,229
It's insane.

286
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,355
Well, I guess that's why
gangsters had molls.

287
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,069
What?

288
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,708
Gun molls.

289
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,797
Haven't you ever seen <i>White Heat?</i>

290
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,353
Yeah, I've seen <i>White Heat...</i>

291
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,358
-...but I don't see how that pertains.
-Maybe you need a moll...

292
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,120
...more than a wife
who you can't trust with your secrets.

293
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,799
-Just--
-What good is money...

294
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,434
...that doesn't spend?
The tree falls in the forest....

295
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,030
You know, you get the point.
So communicating is out?

296
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,508
Out.

297
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,039
Let's see. What else is there?

298
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,435
There's always,
"Hey, I found a big bag of money...

299
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,312
...down by the railroad tracks."

300
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,954
No? No? Works for me.

301
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,869
Uncle Murray.

302
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,074
Oh, yeah.

303
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,678
Yeah,
"Oh, many is the happy memory...

304
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,711
...of Uncle Murray
bouncing me on his knee.

305
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,480
We lost track of
the old pervert years ago...

306
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:06,752
-...but he kicked it, left me millions."
-No, no.

307
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,988
It cannot be blind luck or some
imaginary relative who saves us.

308
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,634
No, I earned that money, me.

309
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,231
And now my son created
his own website...

310
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,274
...SaveWalterWhite.com,
soliciting anonymous donations.

311
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,995
Do you have any idea
how that makes me feel?

312
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,991
Yeah, look at that.
It's got PayPal and everything.

313
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,351
Cyber-begging. That's all that is.

314
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,552
Just rattling a little tin cup
to the entire world.

315
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,228
Yeah, there's no deep-seated
issues there.

316
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,477
Walter, I'm looking at the answer here.
It's staring me in the face.

317
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,353
-Do I have to spell it out for you?
-I know. I know.

318
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,755
You're thinking that I should be
funnelling money...

319
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,996
...into my son's website,
but absolutely not.

320
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,714
I am not going to have
my family think that some...

321
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,990
...mystery benefactor saved us.

322
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,033
Not some mystery benefactor,
singular.

323
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,470
That would raise too many questions.
However--

324
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,636
Stay with me here.

325
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,319
--zombies.

326
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,111
I got a guy, who knows this guy,
who knows this <i>Rain Man</i>-type.

327
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,551
He lives with his mother
in her basement in Belarus, all right?

328
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,558
So good luck extraditing
his fat Russian ass.

329
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,036
Wait. He's a hacker-cracker
extraordinaire.

330
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,754
This guy can hijack
random desktops...

331
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,475
...all around the world, turn them
into zombies that do his bidding.

332
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,958
For instance, he can make it
so 20- or 30,000...

333
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,357
...little donations come in
from all over the U.S. and Canada.

334
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,516
Ten, 20, 50 bucks a pop...

335
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,837
...all paid in full, nice and neat,
untraceable...

336
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,794
...from the good-hearted people
of the world to Mr. Walter H. White...

337
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,036
...cancer saint.

338
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,755
I'm getting a warm and fuzzy feeling
just thinking about it.

339
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,875
He's an asshole, that's what.
Always judging me.

340
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,279
Not too much.

341
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,835
I mean, like, who is he, right?

342
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,634
I mean, first off, I taught him.

343
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,752
Always acting like
I'm his indentured servant.

344
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,838
Now the cotton.

345
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,469
Needle?

346
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,592
-I don't understand why you need him.
-Exactly.

347
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,236
My point exactly.

348
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,236
Flat against your skin
so it doesn't wiggle around too much.

349
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,916
How much does he owe you,
anyway?

350
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,470
Four hundred and eighty.

351
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,871
Oh, hell, I'd be mad too
if somebody owed me 500 bucks.

352
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,196
No, no.

353
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,638
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

354
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,515
What?

355
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,873
What?

356
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,032
Thousand.

357
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,798
Not on your back,
in case you throw up.

358
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,151
On your side. Sleep on your side.

359
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,109
And she's all like:

360
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,710
"Don't preach to me." And I'm like,
"Baby, I'm not preaching to you.

361
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm talking about basic survival,
you know?

362
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,399
I'm conversing
about life and death."

363
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,194
I mean, this here,
what we've been doing...

364
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,356
...hell, Becky knows.

365
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,273
Dad?

366
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,550
I overslept. I'm on my way.

367
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,759
Dad?

368
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,635
Dad, wait.

369
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,195
Dad, it's not what it looks like.

370
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,439
Dad.

371
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,793
Dad, will just wait? Let me--
Just talk to you for one second.

372
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,035
No, Dad.

373
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,435
Dad, come on.

374
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,239
Dad?

375
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,558
Dad, no. No, stop it!
Don't touch him, Dad!

376
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,990
-Dad, stop. Dad, let him go!
-Son of a bitch.

377
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,591
Dad, no. Stop it!
Stop it, Dad! Stop it!

378
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,519
-Get away from me, man. Back off.
-Jesse.

379
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,709
-Jesse, no!
-Back off!

380
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,514
-Okay, everybody just calm down!
-What's with you, yo?

381
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,871
-Because I'll seriously bust you up.
-You miserable little smackhead.

382
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,071
-Get the hell out!
-Hey, I pay my rent, bitch!

383
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,679
All right? I got civil rights.

384
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,553
Dad, no! Okay!

385
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,149
Jesse, come on.
Please, no. Come on.

386
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,035
I pay my rent.

387
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,029
You're going back to rehab.
Today. Now.

388
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,515
Look, as it so happens,
we were just....

389
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,278
We were just talking
about that now.

390
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,596
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I was gonna tell you, okay?

391
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,155
-If you would just let me.
-Eighteen months.

392
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,636
You have been clean for 18 months,
Jane. Why? Why do you do it?

393
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,878
I backslid, okay?

394
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,748
Like, what?

395
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,871
What, you think I'm proud of this?

396
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,832
Like I do it on purpose?

397
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,393
Lying to me...

398
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,433
...shacking up and using
with this scumbag, this loser.

399
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,755
It takes one to know one.

400
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,758
His name is Jesse. You don't know
the first thing about him.

401
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,474
We talk about rehab every night.
It's his idea.

402
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,433
You talk about rehab?
Well, gee, isn't that wonderful?

403
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,318
Thank you for not being judgemental
24 hours a day.

404
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,229
Because that's exactly what I need,
to be judged all the time!

405
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,189
Okay.

406
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,630
You know what you need?
I'll tell you what you need.

407
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,829
What are you doing?

408
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,554
-What are you doing?
-I am calling the police.

409
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,391
-Dad. Dad, no, don't.
-Come on. Come on!

410
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,556
-Dad, no. Don't.
-I have tried 10 years...

411
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,193
...of love and understanding.

412
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,392
Maybe what it takes
is you drying out in a jail cell.

413
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,919
Dad, no.

414
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,351
Yes, I would like to report drug use
in a building that I own.

415
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,677
-Dad. Daddy, no.
-No. It's ongoing. It's illegal activity.

416
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,552
-I'd like to talk to somebody.
-Daddy.

417
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,274
-Would you connect me, please?
-Fine, we'll go to rehab.

418
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,436
I could care less
about him going to rehab.

419
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,949
-I want you in rehab.
-I'll go first thing tomorrow.

420
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,798
Not tomorrow. Today.

421
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,117
I have to call into work.
I have to stop the newspaper.

422
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,108
The last time I went, my houseplants
died because you didn't water them.

423
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,472
Daddy, please?

424
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,829
I'll go.

425
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,474
<i>Albuquerque Police.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call?</i>

426
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,873
Tomorrow.

427
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,674
<i>Hello?</i>

428
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,353
<i>Hello?</i>

429
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,239
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

430
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,629
Tomorrow.

431
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,152
You meant all that?

432
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,393
I don't know.

433
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,874
I just think
if we had enough money...

434
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,234
...nobody could make us
do anything.

435
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,833
Oh, just let it ring.

436
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,395
No, I'm gonna go see who it is.

437
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,158
It's okay, Holly.

438
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,476
It's okay, sweetie.

439
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,309
Good luck with that.

440
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,910
But I'm sure he'd be glad to,
you know, write some--

441
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,636
You know, actually, here he is
right now. So hold on a second.

442
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,872
-What?
-It's one of your....

443
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,914
One of your old students
wants a letter of recommendation.

444
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,318
Oh, okay. Thanks.

445
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,512
Oh, honey,
I think the baby is getting hungry.

446
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,757
-This is Walter White.
-<i>Hello, Walter White.</i>

447
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,069
I'm sorry.
I'm having a little trouble recalling--

448
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,713
It's Jane.

449
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,751
You know, of Jesse and Jane.

450
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,154
<i>Jesse's "junkie girlfriend."</i>

451
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,195
Oh, yes, yes. Of course.
It really has been a long time.

452
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,879
Get somewhere
where you can talk.

453
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,551
Sure. Yes.
I am looking into that as we speak.

454
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,317
How the hell did you get this number?
Did Jesse give it to you?

455
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,159
All Jesse wants
is what's coming to him.

456
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,793
No more, no less.

457
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,399
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

458
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,158
Four hundred and eighty thousand.

459
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:27,635
-He told you about the money.
-<i>He told me everything.</i>

460
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,558
So, what is this?

461
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,236
What, some kind of blackmail
or something?

462
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,317
This is me telling you
to do right by Jesse.

463
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,919
Bring him what you owe him.

464
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,473
<i>I don't call that blackmail.</i>

465
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:46,717
<i>I call that you getting off your ass,</i>
<i>and being a decent human being.</i>

466
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,399
Well, I call it blackmail.

467
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,195
Dialling my number.
Talking to my wife.

468
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,359
And what's your end of this?

469
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,757
How much heroin
does a half a million dollars buy?

470
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,760
For your information,
I am holding Jesse's money for him...

471
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,996
<i>...and he will receive</i>
<i>every last dollar of it.</i>

472
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,599
He will, not you...

473
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,358
...at a time when I see fit.

474
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,915
But I will not contribute
to his overdose.

475
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,710
<i>Now you tell him, if he gets clean--</i>

476
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,831
-If you both get clean--
-<i>You know what?</i>

477
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,632
I take that back. This is blackmail.

478
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,115
Because what I know about you,
high-school teacher...

479
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,834
<i>...turned drug dealer,</i>
<i>with a brother-in-law in the DEA...</i>

480
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,112
<i>...that would make one hell of a story.</i>
<i>National news, I'll bet.</i>

481
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,835
Do right by Jesse tonight
or I will burn you to the ground.

482
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,549
Shit.

483
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,918
He's a high-school teacher. What's
he gonna do, give you a B-minus?

484
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,634
Send you outside
to clap the erasers?

485
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,352
You wouldn't really go to the cops,
would you?

486
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,637
We won't have to. He'll pay.

487
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,114
And what if he doesn't?

488
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,117
Jesse, it's your money.

489
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,598
You're in the right here. He's in
the wrong. He's not stupid. He'll pay.

490
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,678
What is it, really?

491
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,155
You don't want
your half a million dollars?

492
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,750
You wanna renounce your earthly
possessions and become a monk?

493
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,235
No, it's just,
I'm not the kind of dude who rolls.

494
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,557
And by extension, you know,
neither are you.

495
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,230
I mean, he's my partner.

496
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,992
I'm your partner.

497
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,951
<i>The largest land animal</i>
<i>in all the planet...</i>

498
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,720
<i>...lives in a tightly knit</i>
<i>matriarchal society...</i>

499
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,911
<i>...led by the eldest female</i>
<i>in the herd.</i>

500
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,712
<i>Close your eyes and go to sleep.</i>

501
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,714
She is finally asleep.

502
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,995
What you doing,
learning about elephants?

503
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,398
Oh, honey, we're out of diapers.
Would you mind going out?

504
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,633
Jesse.

505
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,753
Not you.

506
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,071
Nice job wearing the pants.

507
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,076
How do I know she'll keep quiet?

508
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,556
I guess you don't.

509
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,879
You'll never hear
from either of us again.

510
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,639
You're not seeing straight, Jesse.

511
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,713
You are making a mistake.

512
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,679
-Do you know what this is?
-It's a whole lot of cheddar.

513
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,393
This is freedom.

514
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,319
This is saying,
"I can go anywhere I want.

515
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,715
I can be anybody."

516
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,319
Who do you wanna be?

517
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,512
Where do you wanna go?
South America? Europe? Australia?

518
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,871
-Is New Zealand part of Australia?
-New Zealand is New Zealand.

519
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,115
Right on.

520
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,357
New Zealand. That's where
they made <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

521
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,313
I say we just move there, yo.
I mean, you can do your art.

522
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,159
Right? Like, you can paint, like,
the local castles and shit.

523
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,351
And I can be a bush pilot.

524
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,028
Yeah. New Zealand.
I can get behind that.

525
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,153
But I guess I'm good anywhere
as long as it's the two of us.

526
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,712
But first, we gotta get clean.

527
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,797
And not because
anybody is telling us to.

528
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,710
-We do this for us, right?
-Yeah. Absolutely. For us.

529
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,753
All this here, we're not gonna
just shoot this up our arms, Jesse.

530
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,949
We're not.

531
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,549
Hell, no. No, no, no.
We're better than that.

532
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,274
We're way better than that. I say....

533
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,155
I say we flush what we've got left
and we start tonight.

534
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,351
Yeah, we can do that.

535
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,558
Definitely.

536
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,318
Excuse me.

537
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,238
What can I get you?

538
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,272
Give me a Fat Tire draught, please.

539
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,713
Damn it.

540
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,072
Hey, honey.

541
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,830
No. I don't know what to tell you.

542
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,158
Three stores I've been to so far,
and not one of them have it in stock.

543
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,911
Well, do they have
to be diapers for newborns?

544
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,873
What if we went up a size
and just kind of....

545
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,591
All right, all right. No, I understand.

546
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,678
All right. No, I'll just keep looking.

547
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,395
I'm pulling into Wal-Mart now, so....

548
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,234
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

549
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,998
Thank you.

550
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,152
God.

551
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,232
Well played.

552
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,631
They found water on Mars.

553
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,955
They have indeed.

554
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,511
Don't know what to do
with that information...

555
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,075
...but, hey, God bless them,
they found it.

556
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,355
Oh, well, actually...

557
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:35,076
...they theoretically can separate
the hydrogen from the oxygen...

558
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,319
...and process that into providing
fuel for manned space flights.

559
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,672
Ostensibly, turning Mars into
a giant gas station.

560
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,598
So it's a....

561
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,234
Yeah. We live in an amazing time.

562
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,151
-To water on Mars.
-To water on Mars.

563
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,072
So, what did you have? Girl or boy?

564
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,476
-Little girl.
-That's nice.

565
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,829
-Thanks.
-Congratulations.

566
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,029
Thank you.

567
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,595
-I have a daughter.
-Yeah?

568
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,353
How old?

569
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,959
Old enough to know better.

570
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,671
Twenty-seven next month.

571
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:21,231
-You have other kids?
-Just the one.

572
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,679
I've got a 16-year-old boy.
Well, he's almost 16.

573
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,835
Jeez. Oh, there's a spread, huh?

574
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,312
But he helps out, though.

575
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,273
He's even changing some diapers
now, so....

576
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,552
It's more than I managed to do
when I was his age.

577
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,193
Kids today grow up faster, I think.

578
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,518
Oh, yeah. Yeah, maybe so.

579
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,952
So, any advice?

580
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,638
Having a daughter. Any advice?

581
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,273
No, not really. Just love them.

582
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,038
Just-- Yeah.

583
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,630
I mean, they are who they are.

584
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,753
Yeah.

585
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,839
I've got this nephew.

586
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,876
This nephew who is--
I mean, he's an adult.

587
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,154
But you can't infantilize them,
you can't live their life for them.

588
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,070
But still, I mean,
there is that frustration.

589
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,713
You know, that....

590
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,151
God, that frustration
that goes along with, you know:

591
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,239
"Yes, as a matter of fact, I do know
what is best for you, so listen."

592
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,351
But of course, they don't.

593
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,948
I mean, what do you do
with someone like that?

594
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,953
Family?

595
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,076
Yeah. Family.

596
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,149
You can't give up on them. Never.

597
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,272
I mean, what else is there?

598
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,114
Jesse, it's me.

599
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,996
Jesse, I just wanna talk.

600
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,837
Jesus.

601
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:49,999
Jesse.

602
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,319
Jesse.

603
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,430
Jesse, wake up.

604
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,154
Jesse, wake up.

605
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,638
No, no, no.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

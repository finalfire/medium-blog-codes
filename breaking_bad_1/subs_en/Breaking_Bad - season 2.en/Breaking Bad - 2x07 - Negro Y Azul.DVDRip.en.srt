1
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,311
<i>The city's called Duke</i>
<i>The state's called New Mexico</i>

2
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,274
<i>Among the gangsters</i>
<i>The gringos' fame is inflated</i>

3
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,352
<i>'Cause of the new drug they created</i>

4
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,918
<i>They say the colour is blue</i>
<i>And the quality pure</i>

5
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,674
<i>This potent drug's runnin'</i>
<i>Through the city</i>

6
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,792
<i>And no one could stop it</i>
<i>If they wanted to</i>

7
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,110
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because</i>
<i>They weren't getting respect</i>

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,836
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"</i>
<i>Who owns the market now</i>

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,319
<i>No one knows the man since</i>
<i>They've never seen his face</i>

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,390
<i>The cartel's 'bout respect</i>
<i>And they ain't forgiving</i>

11
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,834
<i>But that homey's dead</i>
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,154
<i>Heisenberg's fame has got</i>
<i>Down to Michoacan</i>

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,593
<i>From way far away</i>
<i>They want to taste that meth</i>

14
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,195
<i>That blue stuff has crossed the border</i>

15
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,431
<i>Now New Mexico's livin' up to its name</i>

16
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,432
<i>Looks just like Mexico</i>
<i>In all the drugs it's hiding</i>

17
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,557
<i>Except there's a gringo boss</i>
<i>And he's known as "Heisenberg"</i>

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,359
<i>The cartel's runnin' hot because</i>
<i>They weren't getting respect</i>

19
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,996
<i>Talkin' 'bout some "Heisenberg"</i>
<i>Who owns the market now</i>

20
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,319
<i>No one knows the man since</i>
<i>They've never seen his face</i>

21
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,509
<i>The fury of the cartel</i>
<i>Ain't no one escaped it yet</i>

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,754
<i>But that homey's dead</i>

23
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,111
<i>He just doesn't know it yet</i>

24
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,428
Nitrogen bonds to oxygen,
which in turn....

25
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,236
You do know what a bond is?

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,397
A strong force of attraction.

27
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,637
Covalent bonds, ionic bonds.

28
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,038
The coming together of atoms
and molecules to form compounds.

29
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,639
No?

30
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,600
Chemical bonds
are what make matter matter.

31
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,713
Bonds are what hold
the physical world together.

32
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,993
-What hold us together.
-Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it.

33
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,155
Bonds.

34
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,794
Your test score says otherwise.
It tells me you don't get it at all.

35
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,032
Yeah, but, I mean, 58. I was close.

36
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,316
What is "close"?

37
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,397
There's no "close" in science, Barry.

38
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,398
There are right answers
and wrong answers.

39
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,750
"Close" didn't put men on the moon.

40
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,829
Yeah, but I'm just saying, Mr. White,
two points?

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,833
Look, if I don't pass chemistry,
I have to go to summer school.

42
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,433
And, I mean, I really studied.
Like, really, really studied.

43
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,313
Like, all night, hard.

44
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,638
And, I mean, I'm so into chemistry
for, like, the concepts.

45
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,437
I just think I might have, you know,
the attention deficit....

46
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,915
Couldn't you please
just let this slide?

47
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,629
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

48
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,992
The answer is no.
Next time, apply yourself.

49
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,679
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

50
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,271
Are you ducking me, or what?
This makes the third time.

51
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,600
Look, I will be leaving this phone on
for another 15 minutes, so call me.

52
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,510
Oh, and by the way,
that thing we talked about, the....

53
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,280
When I said, "Handle it."

54
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,439
Well, don't. Just let it go.

55
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,073
All right.

56
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,188
Come on.

57
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,278
Jesse, open the door.

58
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,029
I know you're home. Your car is here.
Come on. Hey.

59
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,879
Can I help you?

60
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,434
No. Thank you.

61
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,756
Well, I'm the manager, so can we stop
with the pounding, please?

62
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,199
You're the manager?

63
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,755
Yes. Yes, you can help me.
Absolutely.

64
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,630
I very much need to get inside here,
so if you have a master key....

65
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,355
-You have a key, right?
-Yeah, I have a key.

66
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,633
Look, the person who lives here...

67
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,638
...it's just very important
for me to see him.

68
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,593
-And you knocked, right?
-Yeah.

69
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,711
He didn't answer?

70
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,158
Which means...?

71
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,519
-Look, I'm his father, all right?
-You're Mr. Jackson?

72
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,071
Yes. That's me. Walt Jackson.

73
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,235
And you are...?

74
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,669
-Jane.
-Jane. Very nice to meet you, Jane.

75
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,757
Now, if you wouldn't mind....

76
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,679
Mr. Jackson,
I'm happy to let you use my phone.

77
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,713
-Wanna call him?
-No.

78
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,472
No. I--

79
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,990
As I said, I would like
if you let me inside here...

80
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,510
...so that I can check on
my son's well-being.

81
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,233
You understand?

82
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,432
Look, whatever's going on
between the two of you is family.

83
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,358
I don't get involved in family.

84
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,755
Jesse doesn't want you in,
you're not getting in.

85
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,915
Period.

86
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,758
Sorry.

87
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,677
Come on in, Dad.

88
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,830
-Thanks.
-You okay?

89
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,719
Yeah.

90
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,156
"Jesse Jackson"?

91
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,032
Do you even...?

92
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,838
Oh, I see you have a telephone,
at least.

93
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,237
You know, that blinking thing
I've been calling you on?

94
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,476
Whatever, man.

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,873
-Hey, give me my-- Give--
-I will break this. I will break this!

96
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,469
Damned druggie idiot.
Is this what you've been doing...

97
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,750
...the whole time
I've been trying to reach you?

98
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,589
-No. I've been taking care of business.
-What business?

99
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,234
What business?

100
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,911
The business you put me on, asshole.
What, you already forgot?

101
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,316
This business.

102
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,393
Does that jog your memory?
Son of a bitch.

103
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,278
-You didn't actually--?
-Hey, you said--

104
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,630
You said, "Handle it,"
so, you know, I handled it.

105
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,673
When I said, "Handle it,"
I meant fear and intimidation.

106
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,757
I meant get your money back.
I never meant--

107
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,951
-Oh, didn't mean to kill somebody?
-No!

108
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,993
Well, too late, yo,
because dude's dead.

109
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,997
-Oh, God.
-All right? Way dead.

110
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,159
-Oh, God.
-Oh, and, hey, hey, hey. Here.

111
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,191
Here's your money.

112
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,950
Yeah, 4660 bucks. Your half.

113
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,435
Spend it in good health,
you miserable son of a bitch.

114
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,837
I didn't say I killed him.

115
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,519
Tell me what happened.

116
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,114
Dude's wife crushed his head
with an ATM machine.

117
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,470
-Crushed his--?
-Crushed his head...

118
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,592
...with an ATM machine
right in front of me.

119
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,756
I mean, crushed it like....

120
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,229
Oh, my God, the sound...

121
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,112
...it's still in my ears.

122
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,914
You know, and the blood,
like, everywhere.

123
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:27,148
Like, there was so much,
you would not believe.

124
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,115
Man, will you just please give me--?
Just give me my weed, all right?

125
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,675
It helps with my nausea.

126
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,113
So...

127
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,228
...you did not kill anyone?

128
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,913
Does anybody think
that you killed anybody?

129
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,872
I called the cops.

130
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,230
You called the cops?

131
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,796
Yeah. You know, I called,
and I split, you know?

132
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,991
And then they came in
and busted her.

133
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,468
God, she was--
She was so zapped out of her mind.

134
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,911
You know? It's....
She did it for, like, nothing.

135
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,476
I mean, he told her she was a skank,
but, yo, I mean, she was a skank.

136
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,800
Can this person identify you?
Can she identify you being there?

137
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,515
She couldn't identify
her left ass cheek.

138
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,915
She was so zonked.

139
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,350
And she had this....

140
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,553
God, she had this kid.

141
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,033
Listen, I'm a little fuzzy
on the mechanics here...

142
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,995
...but could you not stop this woman
from killing this man?

143
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,839
Look, she had a gun on me,
all right?

144
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,834
Yeah, my gun, okay? Mine.

145
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,792
Go ahead, say it. Say it.

146
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,834
No, I ain't no Tuco or Krazy-8.
I can't run a crew.

147
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,589
Come on. Come on. Point made, man.
Point made. Yes.

148
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,716
<i>Yo. If I know you, leave a message.</i>

149
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,798
<i>-Hey, it's Badger, man.</i>
<i>-What are you doing?</i>

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,629
<i>-Don't use your real name.</i>
<i>-What? That isn't my real name.</i>

151
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,789
<i>Okay.</i>

152
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,110
<i>Yo, we got those pants you wanted.</i>
<i>Thirty-two large, right?</i>

153
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,709
<i>We got them just for you,</i> jefe.

154
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,275
<i>Let's do some business, yo.</i>

155
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,359
So are you gonna
get back up on that horse?

156
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,512
No.

157
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,518
You get on. All right?

158
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,553
I just want to forget. I just....

159
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,954
Sorry.

160
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,469
Hey.

161
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,796
Hey, what's up with that?

162
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,314
Jesus Malverde,
patron saint of Mexican drug dealers.

163
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,034
Well, yeah, hell,
I know who it is, okay?

164
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,708
Scumbags kneeling down
praying to him:

165
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,869
"Please, Señor Saint.
No DEA, please."

166
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,638
I'm just-- I'm just saying,
why's he on your desk?

167
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,393
Going after neo-Nazis,
you don't wear swastikas, right?

168
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,793
-Sun Tzu.
-Son who?

169
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,673
Sixth-century Chinese general.
Wrote <i>The Art of War.</i>

170
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,477
"If you know your enemy
as yourself...

171
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,114
...you'll fight without danger
in many battles."

172
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,318
Right on.

173
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,152
-Agent Schrader.
-Sir.

174
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,358
-Glad to have you onboard.
-Thanks.

175
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,269
-Everybody getting you settled in?
-Oh, yeah, yeah. Great group of guys.

176
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,677
And gals. And gals.
Guys-- Guys and gals.

177
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,474
Good. You couldn't have
picked a better time to arrive.

178
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,240
We're about to put a big dent
in the cartel. Right, Vanco?

179
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,998
Yes, sir.

180
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,470
Yo, bro, check it out.
It's a satellite picture of you farting.

181
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,272
"Fat Man and Little Boy."
Sounds like you two.

182
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,950
I got your fat man in my pants, bitch.

183
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,992
-Hey, watch it.
-It ain't real, dumb-ass.

184
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,269
Just watch it, is all.

185
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,198
You watch it.

186
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,558
I'm Heisenberg.

187
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,112
You're Heisenberg?

188
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,276
Yeah, I remember you.
You were the cook.

189
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,673
Let's get this over with.

190
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,438
Where's Jesse?

191
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,628
-Busy.
-Hey, that's cool.

192
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,193
Real cool.

193
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,879
Totally cool.

194
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,479
Hey, hey--

195
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,037
It's all there, man. Every dollar.
Case you wanna, like, count it.

196
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,277
-Here?
-I'm just saying....

197
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,232
Just saying, like, we cool, yo.

198
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,476
Ain't got no confusions
and interpretations...

199
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,908
...as to who we work for.

200
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,192
And that's church, yo. For real.

201
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,678
What have you heard?

202
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,394
Did Jesse really...?

203
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,914
I mean, did he really...

204
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,748
...squash that dude's head
with an ATM machine?

205
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,234
Word.

206
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,474
Who's saying that?

207
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,559
Damn, man, it's all over town.
Everybody's like, "Whoa, snap."

208
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,320
Usually I gotta chase dudes down
for their money...

209
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,192
...but today everybody's paying up.

210
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,198
True that. Serious.

211
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,197
But, like....

212
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,953
He really did it?

213
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,749
You didn't hear that from me.

214
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,474
Big lunch.

215
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,439
Thank you.

216
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,190
-Here you go.
-Very good, Ms. White.

217
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,994
We'll consider your application
and let you know.

218
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,428
Thank you.

219
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,552
I'd just like to mention
that I have worked here before.

220
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,829
Really?

221
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,837
When are you due?

222
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,833
-Several months.
-Congratulations.

223
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:03,597
I see. Accounting Department.
You left us four years ago?

224
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,155
Family.

225
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,196
We'll definitely let you know.
Thank you for coming by.

226
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,471
Actually, may I see Ted Beneke?
I-- I think he'll remember me.

227
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,353
Mr. Beneke's very busy today,
unfortunately.

228
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,755
You know, if it's okay, I'll just--

229
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,279
Ma'am--

230
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,392
Skyler. Oh, my God, look at you.

231
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,033
Hey, Ted.

232
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,435
-Come in, come in.
-Okay.

233
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,154
No calls, Margaret, thanks.

234
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,793
Come on, sit down right here.

235
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,150
Okay. Thank you.

236
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,716
-You look great.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

237
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,076
Boy or girl?
Or are you keeping it a secret?

238
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,510
Oh, it's a little girl.
We're very excited.

239
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,359
I'll bet. One of each.

240
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,719
How's Walt Jr.?

241
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,390
Oh, 10th grade,
and he's just growing like a weed.

242
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,079
He's-- He's taller than I am now.

243
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,869
Yeah. I'm betting 6'3", 6'4"
by the time he's finished.

244
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,514
And, wow, handsome. Oh, my God.

245
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,235
Good genes.

246
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,793
Speaking of movie stars,
those can't be the twins.

247
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,070
Oh, yeah. Yep. That's them.

248
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,316
-They're gorgeous.
-Yes, they are.

249
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,035
And they know it.

250
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,958
I'm in real trouble there, huh?

251
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,752
Yeah.

252
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,918
So the big office, huh?

253
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,758
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

254
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,837
Weird, isn't it?

255
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,270
I still think of it as my dad's.

256
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,754
I miss him.

257
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,439
Me too.

258
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,229
I'd like to think he'd be proud.
Last year was our best year yet.

259
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,477
Yeah, he'd be proud.

260
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,039
Walt? How's he doing?

261
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,995
Oh, he's-- He is doing great.
Yeah. He's plugging away.

262
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,476
-Great. He's still teaching?
-Yeah.

263
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,276
-You tell him I said hello.
-I will definitely do that.

264
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,035
To be honest, Ted,
I didn't just stop by to say hello. I....

265
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,358
I was applying for the data-entry job.

266
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,279
You're kidding.

267
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,675
Skyler, you were, like,
our go-to bookkeeper.

268
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,235
Yeah. Well...

269
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,795
...the economy, you know, so....

270
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,390
Well, you, data entry?
That'd be a mistake.

271
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,878
How about...

272
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,753
...get your old job back?

273
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,549
We're expanding, and, well,
between you and me...

274
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,955
...the whole department's
pretty much of a mess.

275
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,749
Your work would be cut out for you...

276
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,557
...but we could use your help.

277
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,753
Okay.

278
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,515
All right. Now, this is our territory,
right? Currently.

279
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,948
Hey. Hello.

280
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,390
-Yeah, man. Current. Whatever.
-Now, look at this.

281
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,431
Here, here, here and here.

282
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,597
What does that look like to you?

283
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,037
Opportunities. Golden ones.
That's what that looks like.

284
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,679
No, look.
Look, it's an entire city full of buyers.

285
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,552
Now, why aren't we exploiting that?

286
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,070
-Because it's not our territory?
-Because we lack initiative.

287
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,508
-Initiative.
-Yes.

288
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,597
You need to employ more dealers.

289
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,030
Double, triple your crew.
Those three I met?

290
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,313
They should each have three, six, nine
sub-dealers working for them.

291
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,476
Exponential growth,
that's the key here.

292
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,198
It's not our territory, man.
Yo, you follow me here, huh?

293
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
We go rolling into
these neighbourhoods...

294
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,879
...other crews ain't gonna take kindly,
you understand?

295
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,635
Sure, they won't like it...

296
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,593
...but I say they're not gonna
do a thing about it.

297
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,677
-No. Listen, Jesse--
-No.

298
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,438
Jesse.

299
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:28,357
The game has changed.
The word is out that you are a killer.

300
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,197
-What are you talking about?
-Apparently, it's all over town.

301
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,789
Somebody crossed you,
you got angry...

302
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,958
...you crushed their skull
with an ATM machine.

303
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,071
-That's not how it happened.
-Who cares...

304
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,431
...as long as it's our competitors
who believe it and not the police?

305
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,791
-Oh, my--
-No, don't you see how great this is?

306
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,908
Look, you-- You are a....

307
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,712
Jesse, look at me.

308
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,352
You are a blowfish.

309
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,676
-What?
-A blowfish. Think about it.

310
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,839
Small in stature,
not swift, not cunning.

311
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,268
Easy prey for predators...

312
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,675
...but the blowfish
has a secret weapon...

313
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,110
...doesn't he? Doesn't he?

314
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,074
What does the blowfish do, Jesse?
What does the blowfish do?

315
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,716
-I don't even know--
-The blowfish puffs up.

316
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,595
The blowfish puffs himself up
four, five times larger than normal.

317
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,268
And why? Why does he do that?

318
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,040
So that it makes him intimidating,
that's why.

319
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,195
Intimidating.

320
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,472
So that the other scarier fish
are scared off.

321
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,319
And that's you. You are a blowfish.

322
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,353
You see, it's just all an illusion.

323
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,438
You see, it's nothing but air.

324
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,319
Now...

325
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,518
...who messes with the blowfish,
Jesse?

326
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,994
-Nobody.
-You're damn right.

327
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,078
-I'm a blowfish.
-You are a blowfish.

328
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,713
-Say it again.
-I'm a blowfish.

329
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,717
-Say it like you mean it.
-I'm a blowfish.

330
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,673
-You're a blowfish. That's right.
-Yeah!

331
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,633
Blowfishing this up.

332
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,068
Hello?

333
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,078
The <i>SkyMall.</i>
Give me the <i>SkyMall</i>, would you?

334
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,953
Vanco...

335
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,550
...new guy don't speak Spanish.
What's up?

336
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,229
Hey, white boy,
better learn Español, huh?

337
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,591
This ain't Branson, Missouri,
know what I'm talking about?

338
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,158
You know what? I'll teach you.

339
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,917
It means, "Let's make a deal."

340
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,315
So go ahead. We're waiting.

341
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,473
Okay.

342
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,879
Right here.

343
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,674
"Item SS4G:

344
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,237
Yankee Stadium final season
commemorative baseball...

345
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,158
...hand-signed by Derek Jeter."

346
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,828
Vanco, write this down.

347
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,312
Oh, man, watch out.

348
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,555
"661 00ZBG: large-size floor runner."

349
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,832
Look at that, huh?
It's a rug you put on the floor...

350
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,793
...except for it looks like
a hundred-dollar bill.

351
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,073
I love them. Get me 20 of them.
I'm gonna put them all over my <i>casa.</i>

352
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,395
We'll get you three.

353
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,556
-No, you give me 10.
-Five.

354
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,711
Hey. How about you stop
jerking us off here?

355
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,758
Where's the meet?
When's it going down?

356
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,311
White boy don't like
let's make a deal, huh?

357
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,193
White boy's gonna kick your ass,
you don't stop wasting time.

358
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,389
Schrader....

359
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,789
Hey, white boy. My name's Tortuga.
You know what that means?

360
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,278
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say that's Spanish for "asshole."

361
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,871
Tortuga means "turtle." That's me.

362
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,713
I take my time, but I always win.

363
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,758
Oh, wait. That reminds me.

364
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,349
I seen this earlier. Lookit.

365
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,312
This is awesome, homes.
Right there, look at that.

366
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,478
"The tranquil tortoise
garden sculpture."

367
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,272
Definitely two of those, huh?

368
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,872
Check it out, huh? Good likeness.

369
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,589
Hank's doing great down there.
He's making inroads.

370
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,234
I'm sure he is. He's a hero, after all.

371
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,398
So you gonna go down to El Paso?

372
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,955
Please. It's Third World enough
around here.

373
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,673
They keep him busy every second.

374
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,791
He's already got some
big operation going.

375
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,275
Some hush-hush deal
he couldn't tell me about...

376
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,710
...except it's on the other side
of the border.

377
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,433
Wow, that sounds exciting.

378
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,071
He's being safe, right?

379
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,271
Yeah.
He says he's mostly riding a desk.

380
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,358
Which, between you and me,
is just the way I want it.

381
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,799
Speaking of riding desks...

382
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,872
...got myself a job today.

383
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,595
You did not.

384
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,674
As big as you are?

385
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,159
-Thank you.
-You know I just mean....

386
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,918
Where? With who?

387
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,669
Well, someone willing
to work around that, apparently.

388
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,835
Beneke.

389
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,555
You did not.
Is Mr. Grabby-Hands still there?

390
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,796
Marie, that was one time
at a Christmas party.

391
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,755
And he was so drunk,
he was practically slurring his words.

392
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,157
-Just what you want in an executive.
-And he apologised profusely.

393
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,796
Plus he's married with a family.
I'm sure he doesn't wanna get sued.

394
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,594
It will not happen again.

395
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,955
Is money that tight?

396
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,313
Yeah.

397
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,398
You know we can always help out.

398
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,957
No, Marie.

399
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,759
You know Walt. He would just....

400
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,315
-Speak of the devil.
-Hey. Hi, Marie.

401
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,158
How are you? What's up?

402
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,992
Nothing much.
How's things with you?

403
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,799
-Good. Good.
-Hi, honey.

404
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,514
-Dinner will be about an hour and--
-Oh, thanks, sweetie.

405
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,235
-Everything okay?
-Everything's perfect.

406
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,153
This is Raisin Bran,
not Raisin Bran Crunch.

407
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,271
So? Same thing.

408
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,959
Not the same thing.

409
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,833
I'll tell you what, why don't you
do the grocery shopping?

410
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,114
And then you can get
whatever you want. Great.

411
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,189
It's-- It's not that hard, Mom.
It says "crunch" on the box.

412
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,549
You're pushing it.

413
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,399
-Morning.
-Morning, honey.

414
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,556
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey.

415
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,718
Dad, notice anything?

416
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,238
Is there a funeral today?

417
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,395
-A funeral?
-Well--

418
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,636
-Oh, Christ, do I look that bad?
-No, no, no.

419
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,831
Mom got a job.

420
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,393
A job? Why?

421
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,034
Well, do I need to get out
the chequebook and show you?

422
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,232
No, I.... Do you think it's a good idea
in your condition?

423
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,034
No, no. The doctor said I can work
up until I go into labour.

424
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,471
And it's just an office job.
I'm just sitting on my butt.

425
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,229
Where?

426
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,553
Beneke.

427
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,228
I'm back working
in the Accounting Department.

428
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,955
Skyler, what about the welding fumes?
Isn't that why you had to quit...

429
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,038
-...in the first place?
-They've gone green since then.

430
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,755
They have some kind of
green welding or something.

431
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,599
I didn't smell anything
when I was in there.

432
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,517
Didn't Mr. Beneke pass away?

433
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,789
Yeah.

434
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,989
Who's running things?

435
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,350
Ted. The son.

436
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,670
Anyway, I have got to go.

437
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,316
I don't wanna be late
my first day back.

438
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,192
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

439
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,118
-Bye.
-Bye.

440
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,673
Okay.

441
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,120
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

442
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,315
Bye.

443
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,153
Hey.

444
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,591
You left your cave.

445
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,718
Yeah.

446
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,434
I was-- I'm missing my TV.

447
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,959
Thinking maybe I'd hit Costco.

448
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,594
You know,
snag a big-ass wide-screen.

449
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,959
So....

450
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,793
Yeah.

451
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,032
What you drawing?

452
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,795
Damn.

453
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,319
That's good.

454
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,112
Make a hell of a tat.

455
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,389
That's the plan.

456
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,715
Really?

457
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,639
I work part-time, down at ABQ Ink.

458
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,875
Right on.

459
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,395
Yo, you're a real good drawer.

460
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,076
I used to do a little of that.

461
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,473
You used to be a drawer too, huh?

462
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,912
What stopped you?

463
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,031
You know, just....

464
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,071
So tell me something.

465
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,478
What kind of tattoo artist
has no tattoos?

466
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,430
That's way too big a commitment.

467
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,351
Hey, man. You're Pinkman.

468
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,750
You're the man!
Everybody's been talking about you.

469
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,359
Yeah.

470
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,830
Right on, man. Keep it real.

471
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,115
"Pinkman," huh?

472
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,673
Yeah.

473
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,030
I thought your name was "Jackson."

474
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,680
Well, your snitch
is really earning his nickname.

475
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,069
Are we...?

476
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,713
Are we just on mañana time?

477
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,194
They'll show.

478
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,039
Yeah? Why is that?

479
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,033
You got more catalogues
for him to clean out?

480
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,757
Maybe a little Sharper Image
or Pottery Barn?

481
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,431
What the hell are they thinking?

482
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:28,029
Sending us some loudmouth
who doesn't speak the language?

483
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,350
Politics, man. Politics.

484
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,037
Supposed to be some hotshot hero.
I say it's a bunch of crap.

485
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,310
Hero for Albuquerque, maybe.
Maybe it don't take much up there.

486
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,116
Hey, something
I need to know about?

487
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,595
What? Oh, that? No, man.

488
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,633
We were just singing your praises.

489
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,068
Glad to have you.

490
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,952
Welcome aboard.

491
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,158
Hey, is that your guy?

492
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,835
Hey, I think that's your guy.

493
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,111
What the hell
is he doing down there?

494
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,958
Schrader, where you going?

495
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,675
We need an evidence bag, right?
A pretty big one.

496
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,670
What's the matter?
You act like you never saw...

497
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,075
...a severed human head
on a tortoise before.

498
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,514
Hey, welcome to--

499
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,553
My leg.

500
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,359
<i>--headed by Werner Heisenberg,</i>
<i>were also undertaken during the war.</i>

501
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,869
The game has changed, yo.

502
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,755
This is our city, all right?

503
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,394
All of it. The whole damn place.

504
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,556
Our territory.

505
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,478
We're staking our claim...

506
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,275
...that we sell when we want,
where we want.

507
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,119
Now, we're gonna be kings,
understand?

508
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,799
Well, I'm gonna be king.

509
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,355
You guys will be princes
or dukes or something.

510
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,074
-I wanna be a knight.
-But first things first.

511
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,272
We gotta get more dealers.

512
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,869
You know, foot soldiers, right?

513
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,798
Now, they'll be working for you.

514
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,958
You're working for me,
and they're working for you.

515
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,152
You follow me?

516
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,078
Layered, like nachos.

517
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,918
Exponential growth.

518
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,556
Now, that's success
with a capital S.

519
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,239
Straight up, straight up.

520
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,395
For shizzle.

521
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,589
Frigging awesome.

522
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,592
Well, we're set.

523
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,156
Our boys are ready.
Gonna be some mad cheddar, yo.

524
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,354
Cheddar, Mr. White.

525
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,599
Fat stacks, dead presidents,
cash money.

526
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,752
Gonna own this city.

527
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,919
We're not charging enough.

528
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,435
What?

529
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,634
You corner the market,
then raise the price.

530
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,350
Simple economics.

531
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,315
Oh, hey, Ted. Come on in.

532
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,318
-Looks like they got you all set up.
-Yeah. It's perfect.

533
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,398
I am close enough to the bathroom
that I don't have to waddle far.

534
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,555
And that's very nice.

535
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,910
-I figured that might be a deal-breaker.
-Yeah.

536
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,709
Listen, I....

537
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,759
I wanted to thank you
for having me back.

538
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,675
You don't have to thank me.
I need you.

539
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,714
Wow, Ted, it's a little early
for wine, isn't it?

540
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,479
Oh, damn. It's grape juice.

541
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,875
Been making the girls
breakfast in the morning.

542
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,479
Hey, how is Denise doing?

543
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,358
We split up, about a year ago.

544
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,713
I'm sorry.

545
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,120
She's definitely happier now.
I guess I am too, most days.

546
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,788
-Together since high school.
-Yeah.

547
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,877
-I remember that.
-Anyway....

548
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,837
I don't know, people change.

549
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,075
Yes.

550
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,748
Anyway, I just wanted
to welcome you.

551
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,349
Welcome you back. And....

552
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,949
I'll see you around
the vending machines.

553
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,599
Okay.

554
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,473
We should have lunch one day.

555
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,874
Like old times.

556
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,119
Sure.

557
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,672
Oh, hey.

558
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,118
Hey, yourself.

559
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,797
So listen. My....

560
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,914
My name is not really
Jesse Jackson.

561
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,556
It's Jesse Pinkman.

562
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,513
And that guy you met...

563
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,231
...he's not my dad.

564
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:46,434
You're not gonna kick me out,
are you?

565
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,359
Because I actually really like it here.

566
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,475
I don't make it my business
what you do.

567
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,475
So long as you don't do it here.

568
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:06,588
So, hey, I got this kick-ass
new flat-screen.

569
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,872
Wanna see?

570
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,395
It's got that thing where the blacks...

571
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,559
...are, like, you know,
really, really, really black.

572
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:49,870
And the Dolby six-point-whatever.

573
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,039
So it'll really rock the house.

574
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,598
But I'll, you know....

575
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,828
I'll keep it way down, of course.

576
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,472
I don't know what the hell
is taking so long.

577
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,393
Come on, come on.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

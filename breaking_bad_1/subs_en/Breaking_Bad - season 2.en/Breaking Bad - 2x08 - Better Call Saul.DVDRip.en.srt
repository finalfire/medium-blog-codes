1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,919
Hey.

2
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,033
You....

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,272
You selling?

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,952
I don't know
what you're talking about.

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,276
Okay. That's cool.

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,514
I'm just saying, you know,
if you were selling...

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,115
...I could maybe do with a teenth.

8
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,512
You're kidding, right?

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,710
Dude, I so smell bacon.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,115
What? What are you talking about?

11
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,912
Oh, gee, I don't know.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,839
How about over there.
That brown van.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,115
That's yours, right?

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,151
What brown van?

15
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,436
Parked all inconspicuous.

16
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,631
It's a cop van.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,760
Yeah, another one right over there.

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,074
"Duke City Flowers"? Come on.

19
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,236
Can't you at least be original?

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,749
Dude, I just wanna get high.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,076
A flower van.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,274
You know what you should do
is a garbage truck.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,357
Seriously, and I don't mean
to disrespect...

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,028
...but if you put cops
in the back of a garbage truck...

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,231
...there's no way
I'm seriously thinking...

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,591
...that there's cops
in the back of a garbage truck.

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,310
It's a freebie, yo. Just think about it.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,590
Think about it, boys.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,473
All right. I'm hitting it.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,038
You dudes give up that easy?

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,151
I'm not a cop.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,156
Then lift your shirt.
Show me you're not wearing a wire.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,279
All right, you know what?

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,153
Just to show you
you're being an asshole.

35
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,351
I'm blinded by white.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,515
Douchebag.

37
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,109
Come on. I was joking. Come on.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,551
Don't walk away angry.
Sit down. Come on.

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,918
I mean, what are you
complaining about?

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,270
You got abs, man. Kind of.

41
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,277
Whatever, dude.

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,118
I'm not even sure
I wanna buy anymore.

43
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,880
I think you turned me off
to the whole thing.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,036
Come on. Don't be like that.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,312
I just need you to prove it,
you know?

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,953
Prove you're not a cop.

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,754
How the hell
am I supposed to do that?

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,192
I don't know.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,591
Hey, I got it. Go over there
and punch that dude right in the face.

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,472
Which dude?

51
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,874
-That dude?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,435
No way. He'd kick my ass.

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,839
True that.

54
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,277
-This is so hard, you know?
-Yeah.

55
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,439
I know.

56
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,398
It's simple.

57
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,872
If you ask a cop if he's a cop,
he's, like, obligated to tell you.

58
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,877
It's in the Constitution.

59
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,116
Constitution of America?

60
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,874
So go ahead and ask.

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,275
-You a cop?
-No, no. Not like that.

62
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,516
Ask it, like, official.

63
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,188
Are you a police officer?

64
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,110
No, I am not a police officer.

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,232
Okay, then. Hundred
and seventy-five for a teenth.

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,117
The price is the price, yo.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,992
All right.

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,193
There you go. Enjoy.

69
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,718
Thanks, man.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,433
Albuquerque Police!
You're under arrest! Get on the ground!

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,918
Get on your stomach now!
On your stomach! Get on the ground!

72
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,872
Hold it right there. Don't move.
Stay down.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,916
<i>I had a good job</i>
<i>until my boss accused me of stealing.</i>

74
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,957
<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,231
<i>I was out partying,</i>
<i>minding my own business....</i>

76
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,956
-<i>You are under arrest.</i>
-<i>I'd better call Saul!</i>

77
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,875
<i>Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.</i>

78
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,718
<i>Did you know that you have rights?</i>

79
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,275
<i>The Constitution says you do.</i>
<i>And so do I.</i>

80
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,357
<i>I believe that until proven guilty...</i>

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,597
<i>...every man, woman,</i>
<i>and child in this country is innocent.</i>

82
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,677
<i>And that's why I fight for you,</i>
<i>Albuquerque.</i>

83
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,835
<i>Better call Saul.</i>

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,031
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law,</i>
<i>505-164-CALL.</i>

85
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,118
<i>That's 505-164-CALL.</i>

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,275
I really need to get some furniture.

87
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,959
I suggest you start with a bed.

88
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,674
God, I wish we could smoke in here.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,077
-Well, you can't.
-Yeah, no. I know.

90
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,191
I'm just saying.

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,272
Don't think I can't smell that weed.

92
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,277
You better seriously hope
that airs out.

93
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,119
My dad will keep
your security deposit.

94
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,431
He has a nose
like a damn bloodhound.

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,198
Yeah?

96
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,439
Has he ever caught you?

97
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,069
Yeah. Many times.

98
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,832
Well, listen.

99
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,711
Since I already lost my deposit
and all...

100
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,388
...maybe we should light up.

101
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,752
No, thanks.

102
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,915
You sure?

103
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,709
Well, is it cool if I burn one?

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,070
Maybe you'll change your mind.

105
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,117
Do what you wanna do, I guess.

106
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,115
Hey. What'd I say?

107
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,073
Nothing.

108
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,117
I just have to go is all.

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,755
What's this?

110
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,793
My 18-month chip.

111
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,355
I'm in recovery.

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,953
And, you know,
pot is like stepping stones.

113
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,233
Recovery? That's cool.

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,714
Right on.

115
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,993
I respect that.

116
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,919
You know,
I don't really burn much anymore.

117
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,918
It's just a sometime thing.

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,952
But no more, like, in the house.

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,477
So you wanna go grab
some dinner?

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,069
I could really go for some Chinese.

121
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,679
No, I better hit it.

122
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,952
We....

123
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,793
We cool?

124
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,713
Your satellite is on, by the way.

125
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,156
That screen is badass.

126
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,871
I just think it's asking a lot.

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,991
He knows it.

128
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,792
He's done nothing but apologise.

129
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,799
Is this gonna be
every weekend now?

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,151
No. It's just the end of the quarter.
You remember how that was.

131
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,751
But I am earning double time,
so there's a bright side.

132
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,235
So when the laziest boy
in the world wakes up...

133
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,317
...tell him he better wash
those sneakers.

134
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,475
And I said bye.

135
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,910
And tell him
to let them air-dry this time.

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,759
I don't want him
banging the hell out of my dryer.

137
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,515
What?

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,196
What, you don't even get
casual Saturday?

139
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,435
I mean....

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,232
No, it's just you....

141
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,271
You look nice is all.

142
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,596
It's work, Walt.
And everybody is gonna be there.

143
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,675
-Okay.
-Okay.

144
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,235
Maybe we'll order a pizza tonight?

145
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,793
Okay.

146
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,435
-Bye.
-Bye.

147
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,272
<i>Hi. You've reached Walt,</i>
<i>Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

148
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,710
<i>Please leave a message,</i>
<i>and we'll get back to you.</i>

149
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,232
<i>Skyler? Are you there?</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

150
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,876
<i>I.... I need to talk to you. I....</i>

151
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,470
Hey, Marie. It's me. What's up?

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,440
Yesterday I got home
and found him.

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,469
He didn't even tell me
he was coming.

154
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,236
-A man was killed?
-A Federale, right in front of him.

155
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,351
Three agents wounded,
one lost his leg.

156
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,030
It's like what you hear about
from Iraq or something.

157
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,913
-The IEDs.
-Oh, Jesus.

158
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,839
I had to hear about it
from Steve Gomez.

159
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,349
Hank talked to his ASAC
for about an hour.

160
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,677
Hank could win an Oscar.
He's so damn breezy with the man.

161
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,792
He hangs up the phone,
goes right back to bed.

162
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,597
And all he keeps saying is,
"I'm fine. I'm fine. Leave me alone."

163
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,352
Baby, not now.

164
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,398
It's-- It's me, Hank. Sorry.

165
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,957
Hey, buddy. What's...?

166
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,639
What's up?

167
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,399
I just....

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,876
Do you mind if I...?

169
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,991
No. No.

170
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,718
So....

171
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,989
How you doing?

172
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,120
Oh, you know, lousy.

173
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,113
Montezuma's revenge, bigtime.

174
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,440
I mean, everything's going through me
like crap through a tinhorn.

175
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,318
Better not get too close.

176
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,353
Well, I'll take my chances.

177
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,875
I guess you heard about
what happened down in Juárez?

178
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,112
Terrible.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,309
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.

180
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,078
It's like <i>Apocalypse Now</i>
down there.

181
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,955
It's like Colonel Kurtz
holed up in his jungle.

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,876
And my SAC in El Paso
sends me home.

183
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,269
Now, that's a sound leadership
decision right there, huh?

184
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,438
You know, you don't put
your second most senior man...

185
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,631
...on the trail
of those motherless bastards...

186
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,229
...you send him home. You know?

187
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,234
I was, you know--
"He's out getting an evidence bag...

188
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,271
...and so ends up
without a scratch on him.

189
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,836
So must be something wrong
with that picture, you know."

190
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,113
So are you home for good then?

191
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,471
No, no. It's....

192
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,389
Playing it by ear. To be determined.

193
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,469
Think you might wanna talk it through
with somebody?

194
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,592
What, a shrink?
No, no, no. Can't go down that road.

195
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,394
Start going down that road,
kiss your career goodbye.

196
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,991
Or Marie. Or me, if you like.

197
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,959
You know, I don't know
how to say this. I....

198
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,871
You know, the things I deal with...

199
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,157
...you and me don't have much of a--

200
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,239
What you might call
"an experiential overlap."

201
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,469
What if I told you we do?

202
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,958
I have spent my whole life scared.

203
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,912
Frightened of things
that could happen...

204
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,350
...might happen, might not happen.

205
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,916
Fifty years I spent like that.

206
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,030
Finding myself awake
at 3 in the morning.

207
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,238
But you know what?

208
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,668
Ever since my diagnosis...

209
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,151
...I sleep just fine.

210
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,113
Okay.

211
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,874
And I came to realise
it's that fear that's the worst of it.

212
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,150
That's the real enemy.

213
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,319
So....

214
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,833
Get up.

215
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,475
Get out in the real world.

216
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,631
And you kick that bastard
as hard as you can right in the teeth.

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,639
Do it again. Go on.

218
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,478
Ten thousand even, same as last time.
It's totally accurate.

219
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,996
You and I,
we are gonna feed this machine.

220
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,670
-I want it running 24 hours a day.
-Right on.

221
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,313
Not yours, I take it.

222
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,149
We got 10, 20, 30...

223
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,150
...44, five each.

224
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,271
Three pounds should be 48 each.

225
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,469
Who's short?

226
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,319
All right. Don't freak, all right?
We didn't get ripped off.

227
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,397
But Badger hasn't kicked in
his full amount.

228
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,795
I know he was planning on pulling
an all-nighter...

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,638
...so he's probably still in the sack.

230
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,549
Then wake him up.
He can sleep after we're paid.

231
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,115
Why you gotta be such a hard-on?

232
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,709
You're not his pal. You're his boss.

233
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,229
This only works when
they're scared of you, remember?

234
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,390
Jack-off.

235
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,557
It's going straight to voicemail.

236
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,959
Voicemail?

237
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,037
Just chill, okay? Count your money.

238
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,274
-Combo.
-<i>Yo, what's up?</i>

239
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,596
You seen Badger?

240
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,397
Don't you cover for him, bitch.

241
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,353
I ask you a straight-up question,
I expect a straight-up answer.

242
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,914
Well?

243
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,996
They were too scared to tell me.

244
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,118
Badger got busted.

245
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,038
He's in jail.

246
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,190
<i>Honey, I'm home!</i>

247
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,516
Too slow! What's up?

248
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,438
Got more lives than a damn cat.

249
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,517
Now if I could only learn
to lick myself.

250
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,671
What's up, guys? Good to see you.
Good to see you. Good to see you.

251
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,509
All right. Let's all get back to work,
for chrissake, okay?

252
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,837
In my office, man. Let's see
what you bozos been up to lately.

253
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,395
You okay?

254
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,033
Hanging in?

255
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,878
What's it look like?

256
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,279
-What's this from A.P.D.?
-Been checking with them to see...

257
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,835
...if they come across
that famous blue meth of yours.

258
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,395
Sure enough, last night.

259
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,909
Got themselves
an honest-to-God dealer.

260
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,271
I was thinking of cruising over
and saying hello.

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,399
Maybe you'd like to go with me?

262
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,755
Yeah. Well, all right.

263
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,636
You told me to my face
you weren't a cop, man.

264
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,152
I feel manipulated.

265
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,873
I thought we were gonna hang out.

266
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,513
We are hanging out, Badger.

267
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,950
You like Badger or Brandon?

268
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,038
I like people who don't, like,
abuse the Constitution.

269
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,355
Badger, listen.

270
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,234
Hey.

271
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,870
I'm trying to help you here, man.

272
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,552
Now, if you just tell me
who your supplier is...

273
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,558
...I think this can end
very well for you.

274
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,592
What are you doing, detective, talking
to my client without me present?

275
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,789
You sneaky Pete.

276
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,354
Which is which?

277
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,869
What, did the academy hire you
right out of the womb?

278
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,798
You guys get younger every--

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,592
What'd you say to baby face?

280
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,153
Did you say anything stupid?

281
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,271
By "anything stupid,"
I mean anything at all.

282
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,835
Look at you.
Mouth open, vocal chords a-twitter.

283
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,270
We'll talk about it later.
Right now, you out.

284
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,597
Ten minutes ago. Go on.
There are laws, detective.

285
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,870
Have your kindergarten teacher
read them to you.

286
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,629
Go grab a juice box.
Have a nap. Go on.

287
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,995
All right.

288
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,792
Who do we have?

289
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,629
Brandon Mayhew.

290
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,991
Brandon Mayhew. All right.

291
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,476
Brandon Mayhew.

292
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,073
-Here we go. Public masturbation.
-What?

293
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,033
I don't get it. What's the kick?
Why don't you do it at home...

294
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,710
...with a big flat-screen TV,
50 channels of pay-per-view?

295
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,309
In a Starbucks. That's nice.

296
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,351
That ain't me, man. I....

297
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,111
I was the guy who was selling meth.
Allegedly.

298
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,031
Okay. All right. I got you.
Meth. Right.

299
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,276
Sorry, that was a little
transpositional error.

300
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,994
Nothing a little Wite-Out
can't take care of.

301
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,998
Yeah, and felony quantity.

302
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,395
-Just barely.
-Yeah, just barely.

303
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,512
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.

304
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,517
But good luck arguing that in court.

305
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,319
Let me get down to brass tacks.

306
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,158
I'm gonna get you
a second phone call.

307
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,271
You're gonna call
your mommy or your daddy...

308
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,755
...or your parish priest
or your Boy Scout leader...

309
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,952
...and they're gonna
deliver me a cheque for $4650.

310
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,674
I'm gonna write that down
on the back of my business card.

311
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,314
Four-six-five-zero. Okay?

312
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,479
And I need that in a cashier's cheque
or a money order, doesn't matter.

313
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,035
Actually, I want it in a money order.

314
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,879
And make it out to
"Ice Station Zebra Associates."

315
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,435
That's my loan-out. It's totally legit.

316
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,596
It's done just for tax purposes.

317
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,234
And after that,
we can discuss Visa or MasterCard...

318
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,149
...but definitely not American Express,
so don't even ask. All right?

319
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,349
Any questions?

320
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,077
You're gonna get me off, right?

321
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,749
What do I look like, your high-school
girlfriend? Five fingers, no waiting?

322
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,477
That's a joke, Brandon. Lighten up.

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,310
Son, I promise you this.

324
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:21,512
I will give you
the best criminal defence...

325
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,039
...that money can buy.

326
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,956
Yeah, but, Francesca,
I took these already.

327
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,798
Didn't I take these already?

328
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,833
It's on your head. You're not
supposed to double up on vitamin A.

329
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,837
It's bad for the liver.

330
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,396
Okay, who's next?

331
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,750
Did him. I did him.

332
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,110
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.

333
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,278
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.

334
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,279
Hang on. I'll get back to you.

335
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,035
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?

336
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,754
Sure. Your commercials?
They suck ass.

337
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,954
I've seen better acting
in an epileptic whorehouse.

338
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,832
Is that like the one
your mom works at?

339
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,713
Is she still offering
the two-for-one discount?

340
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,673
DEA, huh? For a street bust.

341
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,872
Now, what would two feds
want with that little twerp?

342
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,277
Sooner or later,
this was gonna happen.

343
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,710
You want your exponential growth...

344
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,876
...guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.

345
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,878
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?

346
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,672
This is who he hires?

347
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,758
What? Are you kidding me?
This is the guy you want.

348
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,678
This is the guy I'd hire.

349
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,759
It's the guy you'd hire.

350
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,234
Look, you remember Emilio?

351
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,433
Okay, this dude got Emilio off,
like, twice. Okay?

352
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,997
Both times, they had him
dead to rights, yo. And then, poof.

353
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,315
Dude is like Houdini.

354
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,238
Seriously,
when the going gets tough...

355
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,192
...you don't want a criminal lawyer.

356
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,597
You want a "criminal" lawyer.

357
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,518
Know what I'm saying?

358
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,076
Look, we're in good shape,
Mr. White.

359
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,430
Badger is way too loyal to roll.

360
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,517
Plus, he's scared shitless of me,
all right.

361
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,838
We pay four large. Cost of business.
Take it out of his payroll.

362
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,712
And it's only his first dealing rap...

363
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,388
...so, worst-case scenario,
you know, they plead him out.

364
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,990
He does five months picking up litter
in an orange jump suit.

365
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,948
So who goes inside?
I don't need them seeing my face.

366
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,594
Well, I don't need them
seeing my face.

367
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,758
Why not?
You look like his typical clientele.

368
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,359
Dick.

369
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,993
Fine.

370
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,074
We'll flip for it, all right? Call it.

371
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,158
Heads.

372
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,677
Mayhew? Mr. Mayhew?

373
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,875
Mr. Mayhew.

374
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,913
Nice of you to come down. Please.

375
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,309
Look at you.

376
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,349
Should I call the FBI
and tell them I found D.B. Cooper?

377
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,675
Joking.

378
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,871
I-- Please, come on.

379
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,798
Come on. Please.

380
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,718
Hello.

381
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,953
Saul Goodman. Please sit.

382
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,110
So it's a shame that we have to meet
under these circumstances.

383
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,153
I believe you have
something for me?

384
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,391
Oh, yes.

385
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,072
-Mayhew. Is that Irish or English?
-Irish.

386
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,999
Faith and begorra.
A fellow potato-eater.

387
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,479
My real name is McGill.

388
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,798
The Jew thing
I just do for the homeboys.

389
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,879
They all want a pipe-hitting member
of the tribe, so to speak.

390
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,193
I digress.
Good things are happening.

391
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,075
Fact is, your nephew is gonna
get out in no time.

392
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,838
That's wonderful, yeah.

393
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,315
There's still a few details
to be ironed out...

394
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,397
...but now that the DEA
is involved...

395
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,150
...I think he's looking
at time served, then probation.

396
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,591
So leave your number with Francesca,
and we'll be in touch.

397
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,358
-Excuse me, the DEA?
-Yeah.

398
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,996
That's the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The feds.

399
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,995
I hope that I'm not
the breaker of bad news...

400
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,590
...but your nephew got mixed up
with some pretty nasty customers.

401
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,755
I understand that.

402
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,598
What does that have
to do with the DEA?

403
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,233
They're after some mystery man...

404
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,795
...some heavy-hitter
that goes by the name Heisenberg.

405
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,309
They want this guy
like the axe wants the turkey.

406
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,351
Seems young Brandon
may have information...

407
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,312
...that could lead to his arrest.

408
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,751
Jesus, cheer up.
This is good news.

409
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,394
I mean, Brandon fell head-first
into the doo-doo pile...

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,477
...and came up
smelling like Paco Rabanne.

411
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,632
Wait, wait. Look, I just.... I think....

412
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,755
I just think that we should
review our options.

413
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,313
Options?

414
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,431
I'm gonna tell you
what your options are.

415
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,076
You got a grand total of two.
Option A: Brandon takes the deal.

416
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,350
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary...

417
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,074
...and gets his rectum
resized about yay big.

418
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,750
Look, look. What about reprisals?

419
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,678
I mean, if Badger--

420
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:35,113
If Brandon informs
on this Heisenberg....

421
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,192
I mean, what if, God forbid...

422
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,996
...that they decide to take revenge?

423
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,918
What have you been telling him?

424
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,396
The kid keeps spouting off about,
"If I talk, they'll kill me."

425
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,398
Right now, he's the only thing
holding up this deal.

426
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,118
-Good.
-No, that's not good. That's terrible.

427
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,278
Trust me, sir, your nephew
won't last in prison two weeks.

428
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,040
You let him take his chances
on the outside.

429
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,117
Maybe I can work
in some witness protection.

430
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,835
No, look, look.
These are vicious, desperate people.

431
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,795
I've been told that
one of them killed another man...

432
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,310
...by crushing his head
with an ATM machine.

433
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,835
People love to take credit
for the fun ones.

434
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,350
The guy who got his head smooshed
used to be a client of mine.

435
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,028
His wife killed him, all right?
It was open and shut.

436
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,629
Trust me, you folks have
nothing to worry about, okay?

437
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,037
I'm gonna set your nephew straight,
get him singing like a canary...

438
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,549
...all's right with the world.

439
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,596
Ten thousand dollars.

440
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,393
Ten thousand, cash to you.

441
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,075
I'm not saying to throw the case.

442
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,149
Just no talking to the DEA.

443
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,355
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

444
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,439
Yes.

445
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,998
What's it going to be?

446
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,630
What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?

447
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,679
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?

448
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,472
Yeah. "Morally outraged," he said.

449
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,033
Threatened to call the police.

450
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,995
-Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?
-Like the <i>Exxon Valdez.</i>

451
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,991
So, what do we do about it?

452
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,196
Hey, Francesca,
how about I follow you home?

453
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,389
No.

454
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,192
For safety.

455
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,879
What?

456
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,433
God, you are killing me
with that booty.

457
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,034
Talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, guys, huh?

458
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,710
Come on, just tell me what you want.
Jesus!

459
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,911
Oh, no, no, no!

460
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,918
No, it wasn't me.
It was Ignacio. He's the one.

461
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,759
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

462
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,317
Shut up, dude.

463
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,752
Shut up, all right?
Just speak English.

464
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,713
Lalo didn't send you? No Lalo?

465
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,312
-Who?
-Oh, thank God! Oh, Christ!

466
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,954
Oh, I thought....

467
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,990
What can I do for you gentlemen?

468
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,509
Anything.
Just tell me what you need.

469
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,633
This afternoon, an associate of ours
offered you $10,000.

470
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,319
You should have taken it.

471
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,478
Wait a minute.
This is in regards to what's-his-name?

472
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,989
Badger! Brandon Mayhew.

473
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,590
The uncle. That was your guy?

474
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,399
No offence, but I don't take bribes
from strangers, you know?

475
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,830
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.

476
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,272
-But I'll take your money! Sure!
-No, that offer has expired, yo.

477
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,234
It was kind of low anyways.
But okay, okay, I'll take it.

478
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,078
Just tell me what you need,
all right?

479
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,271
I'm easy. I'm gonna keep
a happy thought...

480
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,675
...and assume
this is just a negotiating tactic.

481
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,792
All right, listen to me very carefully.

482
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,797
You are going to give
Badger Mayhew...

483
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,992
...the best legal representation ever.

484
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,350
But no deals with the DEA.

485
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,075
All right? Badger will not identify
anyone to anybody.

486
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,714
If he does, you're dead.

487
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,955
Why don't you just kill Badger?

488
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,513
I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito
is buzzing around you...

489
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,792
...and it bites you on the ass,
you don't go gunning for the attorney.

490
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,276
You go grab a fly swatter.
I mean, so to speak.

491
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,717
I mean, all due respect,
but do I have to spell this out for you?

492
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,192
-We're not killing Badger, yo!
-Then you got real problems, okay.

493
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,311
Because the DEA
will come down on your boy...

494
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,351
...like a proverbial ton of bricks.

495
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,551
I don't think
I'm going out on a limb here...

496
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,478
...but, hey,
he's not gonna like prison.

497
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:08,992
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion
regardless of what you do to me.

498
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,588
Mr. Mayhew?

499
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,670
I recognise your cough. Take that
mask off, you know. Get some air.

500
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,473
Go on.

501
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,918
-God.
-Take it easy.

502
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,634
Breathe in, breathe out.

503
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,549
All right. I'm gonna stand up, all right?
Because I got bad knees.

504
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,032
That's better.

505
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,196
Okay, now listen. The three of us
are gonna work this out.

506
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,833
Yeah? How?

507
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,674
First thing, you'll put a dollar
in my pocket, both of you.

508
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,470
You want attorney-client privilege,
don't you?

509
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,592
So that everything you say
is strictly between us.

510
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,552
I mean it. Put a dollar in my pocket.

511
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,318
Come on, make it official.

512
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,952
Come on, do it.

513
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,833
That's it, come on. Just a dollar.

514
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,395
All right, now you, ski bum.
Come on. Give with the dollar.

515
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,029
-Go on.
-Be smart.

516
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,639
What?

517
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,878
-All I got is a five.
-I'll take a five.

518
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,516
Come on, already.
Come on. Be cool.

519
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,751
Okay, you're now both
officially represented...

520
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,473
...by Saul Goodman and Associates.

521
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:38,878
Your secrets are safe with me
under threat of disbarment. All right?

522
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,431
Take the ski mask off. I feel like I'm
talking to the Weather Underground.

523
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,157
Just do it.

524
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,831
Okay, so if a prison shanking
is completely off the table....

525
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,234
And we're sure of that?

526
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,193
No shanking!

527
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,553
All right, all right.

528
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,392
The way I see it is
somebody is going to prison.

529
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,957
It's just a matter of who.

530
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,477
All right. Lame-ass TV ads aside...

531
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,036
...your lawyer here,
he cooked you up a pretty killer deal.

532
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,434
Time served, no probation.

533
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,837
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.

534
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,995
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.

535
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,156
You don't give us
the name of your supplier...

536
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,432
-...you're going nowhere.
-The tough guy act is unnecessary.

537
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,835
This young man
is cooperating fully.

538
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,838
Is that right?
Yeah, you cooperating?

539
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,393
Okay, let's start with a name.

540
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,751
He just goes by Heisenberg.

541
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,235
Heisenberg, huh?

542
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,959
How old is this Heisenberg?

543
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,269
Old. Like 50 or 70 or something.

544
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,516
-Height?
-Average, I guess.

545
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,517
Medium height, medium weight.

546
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,598
-What colour hair?
-No hair.

547
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,358
Dude is balder than you.

548
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,835
1963, James Edward Kilkelly...

549
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,429
...is convicted of stealing
a vending machine.

550
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,313
1975, breaking and entering.

551
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,034
1982, grand theft auto.

552
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,470
1984, armed robbery.

553
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,832
1987, 1992. You get the idea.
And here he is today.

554
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,837
Better known as Jimmy In-'N-Out.

555
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,319
City, state and federal, he's spent
44 of the last 58 years inside.

556
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,635
Entire life behind bars.

557
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,270
Jimmy provides
a very special service.

558
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,199
For a price,
Jimmy will go to prison for you.

559
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,709
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?

560
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,431
He's actually
more comfortable inside.

561
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,949
The outside world
hasn't been too kind to him.

562
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,831
Sometime during
the Clinton administration...

563
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:01,999
...Jimmy figured out how he could
use his talents to turn a profit.

564
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,916
-So when does all this happen?
-It's already happening.

565
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,348
The buy is set for tomorrow.

566
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,120
Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out,
everybody's happy...

567
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,198
...and all it's gonna cost you
is 80 thousand and one pound...

568
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,833
...of your finest meth.

569
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,955
Eighty thousand dollars
for eight years of his life, huh?

570
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,276
First of all,
he's not gonna do eight years.

571
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,198
I'll represent him, and I guarantee...

572
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,756
...there's gonna be some unexpected
problems with the prosecution's case.

573
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,474
Secondly, he gets 30.
Fifty goes to me.

574
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,592
-You get 50? For what?
-For facilitating.

575
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:44,360
Who's taking a bigger risk here?
He likes prison.

576
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,471
You did bring the cash, didn't you?

577
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,638
Look, if this option
is too expensive...

578
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,116
...you can still always...Badger
in the chow line.

579
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,671
Conscience gets expensive,
doesn't it?

580
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,789
All right. There's our boy.

581
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,115
Right on time.

582
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,998
-Go back.
-What? All right, all right, all right.

583
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,830
So, what do you think?
They see us?

584
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,037
No, man, I think we're good.

585
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,231
Badger looks like
he's gonna throw up.

586
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,039
Give me those back.

587
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,117
Just give them to me.

588
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,478
Oh, no.

589
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,189
Where the hell is Jimmy?

590
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,311
Should've been here
10 minutes ago.

591
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,036
You think Jimmy is actually for real?
A guy who wants to be in prison?

592
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,511
There's more
than one kind of prison.

593
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,472
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

594
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,035
There he is-- Wait a minute.

595
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,630
-Oh, no, no, no.
-What? What? Let me see.

596
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,236
-Who the hell is that?
-I don't know.

597
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,633
Mr. Heisenberg, I presume.

598
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,232
Time to move?

599
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,476
Not till we see the exchange.

600
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,078
No, no. Oh, shit!

601
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,238
-What?
-Now he shows.

602
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,431
Okay, let's do this.

603
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,714
No, no.

604
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,354
Oh, my God.
Jimmy is on the wrong bench. Crap!

605
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,551
We're screwed!

606
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,079
What are you doing?

607
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,316
Hey, what are you doing?

608
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,037
I don't get it. What's the holdup?

609
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,548
Where's the stuff, man?

610
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,796
-Where are we going?
-Just shut up.

611
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,589
Get out. Go stop him.

612
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,109
The DEA is right there.
If they see me, we're screwed.

613
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,753
Get out. I'll do something.

614
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,871
-What?
-Just go!

615
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,316
Hank, I thought that was you.

616
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,033
Schrader, I'm blocked.

617
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,879
-Walt, not a good time.
-How you doing? You feeling okay?

618
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,035
Schrader, I'm blocked.

619
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,631
We're working.
You gotta get out of here.

620
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,037
-Working? Oh, like DEA working?
-Schrader, we're missing it. Schrader.

621
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,196
Is something going down?

622
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,794
Wrong guy, wrong guy.
Other bench.

623
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,389
Walt, Walt.

624
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,636
-Walter, move your ass now.
-Okay.

625
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,558
Listen, I'll just go, leave you alone.

626
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,433
-We'll talk about it later. Just floor it.
-Should I back up?

627
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,993
-Go that way.
-Forward is better?

628
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,952
I'll be out of the way there.
Okay, okay.

629
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,515
I'm sorry, all right? I'm sorry.

630
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,188
-I'll leave you alone.
-We'll talk later. Just go.

631
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,673
Where'd he go?
Where the hell did he go?

632
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,677
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Got him.

633
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,915
-Looks like it's going down.
-Take him.

634
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,478
Freeze! Hey, right there.
Don't move.

635
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,153
Come on, let's get him up.

636
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,152
Jesus!

637
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,872
I think they bought it.

638
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,469
<i>Absolutely.</i>

639
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,911
Textbook bust, sir. Yes, sir.

640
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,554
Looks like we got a full pound
of the blue stuff.

641
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:57,311
Oh, and Heisenberg's real name?
James Kilkelly.

642
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:02,473
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It was my pleasure.

643
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,394
Hey.

644
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,749
You weren't home,
so I let the delivery guys in.

645
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,236
-I hope that's okay.
-Absolutely.

646
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,310
So you bought a bed.

647
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,789
Yeah.

648
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,998
What is that, a king?

649
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,913
Pillow top?

650
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,394
Oh, my God.
You really are a chemistry teacher.

651
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,593
You mind?

652
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,636
I was terrible at chemistry.

653
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,354
I'm more of a humanities guy.

654
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,028
-How did you find me?
-We should talk about that.

655
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,392
It should be much, much harder
for people to track you down.

656
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,158
My Pl charged me for three hours...

657
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,193
...so I seriously doubt
it took him more than one.

658
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,992
So this is, what, blackmail?

659
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,838
Walter, I'm your lawyer.

660
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,272
Anything you say to me
is totally privileged.

661
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,914
I'm not in the shakedown racket.

662
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,429
I'm a lawyer. Even drug dealers
need lawyers, right?

663
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,632
Especially drug dealers.

664
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,919
So, what, you're just doing this
out of the kindness of your heart?

665
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,591
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?

666
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:32,717
By the way,
where do you keep the money?

667
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,038
Is it in your mattress? Is it in a jelly jar
buried in the side yard?

668
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,073
This kid Mayhew may be the first
of your guys to get picked up...

669
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,508
...but he won't be the last.

670
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,110
And if I can find you,
how far behind can the cops be?

671
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,673
I don't understand.

672
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,633
What exactly are you
offering to do for me?

673
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,992
What did Tom Hagen
do for Vito Corleone?

674
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,358
I'm no Vito Corleone.

675
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,199
No shit. Right now, you're Fredo.

676
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,833
But with some sound advice...

677
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,315
...and the proper introductions,
who knows?

678
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,397
I'll tell you,
you've got the right product.

679
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,239
Anything that gets the DEA's panties
in this big a bunch...

680
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,032
...you're on to something special.

681
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,438
And I would like to be
a small and silent part of it.

682
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:18,909
Food for thought, yeah?

683
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,391
So if you wanna make more money
and keep the money that you make...

684
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,596
...better call Saul!

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

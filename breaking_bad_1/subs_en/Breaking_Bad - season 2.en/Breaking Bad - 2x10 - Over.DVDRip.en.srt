1
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,754
You're not thinking about
going to work today, are you?

2
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,432
Thought I would. That inhaler really
seems to be doing the trick.

3
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,556
-What?
-Just take the rest of the week.

4
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,354
Please. You've earned it.

5
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,198
Don't push it.

6
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,392
Besides, I want you well
for the weekend.

7
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,949
Mom wants to party.

8
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,675
It's just a little get-together,
that's all.

9
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,111
Sunday afternoon, maybe?
Nothing too big.

10
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,073
Just family and a few friends.

11
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,393
We've got a lot to celebrate.
Don't you think?

12
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,753
Sounds good.

13
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,593
Oh, thank you.

14
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,358
Now...

15
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,310
...what are you supposed
to do today?

16
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,717
-Nothing.
-Excellent.

17
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,915
Brownie points for taking a nap.

18
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,633
Can you meet?

19
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,633
I thought maybe you
might have, you know...

20
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,239
...kicked.

21
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,670
Signed-- Signed off.

22
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,348
I was even checking the obits.

23
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,478
No such luck.

24
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,358
So where does it stand?

25
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,629
Coughing up blood,
giving speeches, you know, like:

26
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,593
"I deserve this. I'm an asshole."

27
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,438
What's the upshot?

28
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,674
The upshot.

29
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,717
The upshot is that
I have radiation pneumonitis.

30
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,715
Damn.

31
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,115
Actually, it's not
as bad as it sounds.

32
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,473
It's a fairly common occurrence,
easily treated.

33
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,197
In fact...

34
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,233
...the news is all good.

35
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,878
What do you mean, good?

36
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,360
You mean, like, "good" good?

37
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,518
What, you mean, like,
remission good?

38
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,989
Remission. Not to imply I'm cured.
I still have cancer.

39
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,275
But there's been a significant
reduction in the tumours.

40
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,917
How significant?

41
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,192
Eighty percent.

42
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,471
Dude. No way.

43
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,638
Now, I'm not out of the woods yet,
not by any stretch...

44
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,635
...but "options" is the word
they keep bandying about.

45
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,673
That's awesome. Serious?

46
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,474
That's-- That's great, man.

47
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,070
I mean, my aunt, she never--
I mean, you know, at your stage...

48
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,396
...I didn't think that could happen.

49
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,999
Yeah.

50
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,590
Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo!

51
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,473
No. You must be so psyched.

52
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,397
Of course. I am.

53
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,835
Okay, now we....

54
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,075
I mean, what do we...?

55
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,113
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

56
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,109
So how do you want to...

57
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,228
...you know, proceed...

58
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
...in light of this kick-ass news?

59
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,078
We'll take our time
and stay cautious.

60
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,191
Sell off what we have.

61
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,958
And then....

62
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,477
Well, then I guess...

63
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,199
...I'm done.

64
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,435
-Batter up.
-Everyone?

65
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,760
Hey, you guys.
I would like to make a toast...

66
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,717
-...with my non-alcoholic beverage.
-Somebody kill the music.

67
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,597
I know one party
can't begin to repay...

68
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,794
...all your support
and your many, many kindnesses.

69
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,195
But then again...

70
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,757
...Hank does make
one mean margarita.

71
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,912
We really do want to thank you.

72
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,396
These last few months have been...

73
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,511
...wow, a challenging time,
to put it mildly.

74
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,075
But I have to say
Walt's come through it like a champ.

75
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,272
-All right.
-Honey, I'm so proud of you.

76
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,078
We all are.

77
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,430
Okay, I'm gonna stop
with the sappy stuff. I am.

78
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,517
But it's true. It really is.

79
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,030
And for the first time
in a long time...

80
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,073
...we are so excited about the future.

81
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,513
Okay, anyway...

82
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,280
...I want to also
express my gratitude...

83
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,235
...to two very special people
who couldn't be here today.

84
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,273
But they send their regrets
and their warm wishes.

85
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,152
Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz...

86
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,238
...for those of you
who don't know them, are....

87
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,031
Well, they're heroes.

88
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,994
They are incredibly generous friends
who made the amazing offer...

89
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,873
...to pay for Walt's treatment.

90
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,478
And they did.

91
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,199
So...

92
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,313
...to Gretchen and Elliott.

93
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,076
-To Gretchen and Elliot.
-Cheers.

94
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,033
Hey, how about the man of the hour?
Come on.

95
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,559
-Speech.
-Yes.

96
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,193
-Speech.
-Yeah, Dad.

97
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,675
Come on, Walt. Speech.

98
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,478
Well, it's....

99
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,159
It's kind of funny.

100
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,595
When I got my diagnosis, cancer...

101
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,790
...I said to myself, you know:

102
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,189
"Why me?"

103
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,799
And then...

104
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,112
...the other day,
when I got the good news...

105
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,430
...I said the same thing.

106
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,794
Anyway.

107
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,877
Thank you for coming.

108
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,517
And enjoy.

109
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,199
-All right, cheers.
-Yeah.

110
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,674
Cheers.

111
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,998
Inspirational.

112
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,312
Tell you what. I gotta give
those bastards points for originality.

113
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,509
I'll tell you that much.

114
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,156
A little mercury switch,
9-volt battery...

115
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,319
...five or six ounces of C-4,
that's how those cartel boys party.

116
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,194
Yeah, but why a turtle?

117
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,960
Oh, that's the best part. It was a....

118
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,469
It was a.... What the hell's the word
I'm looking for?

119
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,191
Not a metaphor, not an analogy,
it's a....

120
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,789
Walt, what's the word
I'm looking for?

121
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,993
Anyway...

122
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,795
...Tortuga. Okay?
That was the name of our snitch.

123
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,195
Bean-speak for tortoise. Okay?

124
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,916
Tortoise, turtle, what have you.
I never knew the difference myself.

125
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,395
Hey, top me off there,
will you, buddy?

126
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,192
Anyway.

127
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,153
Poetic.

128
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,194
I guess, yeah. Poetic. It was poetic.
That's the word.

129
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,231
I guess that's the word.

130
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,435
Go ahead.

131
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,712
Better not let your mom see.

132
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,275
Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair.
Maybe two.

133
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,433
-There's no worm in this, right?
-No, that would be mescal.

134
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,835
Talk about your hangovers, okay?

135
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,998
I was down in Glynco, Georgia.
I was back east, doing some training.

136
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,431
Had this firearm instructor
who was....

137
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,200
He was a good old boy, you know?
Hey. There you go. Thanks.

138
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,631
I mean, this guy could put them away
like he had two livers, okay?

139
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,354
Like a fish, okay? Like a drunk fish.

140
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,437
We were drinking mescal stupid.

141
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,676
But-- Hey, hey.

142
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,634
Walt, what you doing there?

143
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,473
What does it look like I'm doing?

144
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,598
The kid's 16.

145
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,111
What are you going for,
Father of the Year?

146
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,756
What are you looking at him for?

147
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,432
We're celebrating. Come on.

148
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,993
That's all right.

149
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,588
No.

150
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,118
Jesus.

151
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,429
Listen, I'd take a pass on that one
if I were you, okay?

152
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,677
Think we've been bogarting
this puppy long enough.

153
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,153
Hey.

154
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,669
Bring the bottle back.

155
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,518
Sorry, buddy. No can do.

156
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,398
It's my son. My bottle. My house.

157
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,997
-It's all right.
-What are you waiting for?

158
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,349
Bring it back.

159
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,671
Why don't we just call it a day?

160
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,399
All right, pal?

161
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,877
-We good?
-The bottle.

162
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,869
Now.

163
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,797
What's going on?

164
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,353
Jesus.

165
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,555
Here, sweetie. Okay. Okay.

166
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,352
Oh, my God.

167
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,391
Okay. Okay.

168
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,677
There you go. Okay. That's it.

169
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,075
Just get it out. That's okay.

170
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,989
This is your brain.

171
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,432
This is your brain on drugs.

172
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,751
You weren't supposed to wake up.

173
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,076
Ever or...?

174
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,670
No, I was just thinking
that I'd bring it, you know, in.

175
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,276
You want me to go back to bed?

176
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,956
No, I guess that'd be kind of--

177
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,358
No.

178
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,319
Need some help?

179
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,351
No, I got it.

180
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,479
Just have a seat.

181
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,432
Is there any coffee?

182
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,715
Yeah, shit. One second.

183
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,797
Well, at least let me do that.

184
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,037
No, I don't want you to have
to do anything, you know?

185
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,150
All right. Here.
You take the good one.

186
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,239
It's huevos rancheros.

187
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,234
-I can tell.
-Yeah?

188
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,075
-Fork.
-Oh, yeah.

189
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,839
There you go.

190
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,396
So, what are you up to today?
Working?

191
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,956
-Whatever that means.
-No.

192
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,438
I'm all yours.

193
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,789
Really?

194
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,474
<i>Hey, this is Skyler.</i>
<i>Please leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

195
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,874
Hi.

196
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,151
I just wanted to say that....

197
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,509
No.

198
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,393
We'll talk tonight...

199
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,229
...but I wanted to say that...

200
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,037
...I'm not exactly sure
who that was yesterday...

201
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,071
...but it wasn't me.

202
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,279
And I'm sorry.

203
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,113
Love you.

204
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,758
Oh, boy.

205
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,795
<i>I just wanted to say that....</i>

206
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,149
<i>No.</i>

207
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,872
<i>We'll talk tonight,</i>
<i>but I wanted to say that....</i>

208
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,399
Hey there.

209
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,354
-Wow, who brought the churros?
-That would be me.

210
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,870
If I leave them at home, I'll just
wind up eating them all myself, so....

211
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,838
They're actually-- They're leftovers.
We had a little get-together for Walt.

212
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,871
It wasn't his birthday, was it?

213
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,838
Actually...

214
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,598
...Walt's got....

215
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,469
He's been battling cancer.

216
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,033
-Skyler--
-And last week we got good news.

217
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,199
-I'm so sorry.
-But we're really optimistic.

218
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,674
Great.

219
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,390
-Great. Good news is great.
-Yeah.

220
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,955
Yeah, it is. It really is.

221
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,393
Well...

222
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,354
...feel free to bring these any time.

223
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,039
Yeah.

224
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,915
Got some real beauts.

225
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,434
You cannot beat
the thermal efficiency of the C3.

226
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,119
Yeah?

227
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,078
Then again, what about tankless?

228
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,278
Sure. We got them.

229
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,994
The good ones will
really run up your price though.

230
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,158
Set you back about 1200.

231
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,435
It's not an issue.

232
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,348
You want installation, right?

233
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,997
-No. I'm gonna do it myself.
-That's what I like to hear.

234
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,152
And who's this?
This guy can surf without a board?

235
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,270
That's Hover Man.

236
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,233
He can surf, skate, glide...

237
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,797
...whatever, because he's always got
a 6-inch cushion of air under his feet.

238
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,389
That's cool. Great lines.

239
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,910
And this guy?
What's his superpower?

240
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,989
That's Kanga-man.

241
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,668
Kanga-man?
Half-man, half-kangaroo?

242
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,989
-And who's this in his pouch?
-His sidekick, Joey.

243
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,638
He rides around in his pouch
and, you know...

244
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,354
...fights crime.

245
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,393
So that makes Kanga-man a she.

246
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,912
You know that, right?

247
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,595
Only female kangaroos
have pouches.

248
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,199
Yeah, yeah, I know.

249
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,755
But, you know, it's definitely a dude.

250
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,155
He's a product of experimentation.

251
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,195
He's kind of hot, I guess.
Nice haunches.

252
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,511
-And this is?
-It's Backwardo.

253
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,273
Wait, no. I actually--
I changed it to Rewindo.

254
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,471
Anyways, he goes backwards.

255
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,272
He can make everything
go in reverse.

256
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,436
Time and stuff? Like time travelling?

257
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,074
No, he just walks backwards.

258
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,950
He walks backwards?

259
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,198
Is that a superpower?
What good is that?

260
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,675
No, I mean, he does it,
like, really fast.

261
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,678
Okay, look, say someone's
coming at him with a knife, right?

262
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,031
I mean, it's helpful. Then he can just
zip backwards away from them.

263
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,832
Okay.

264
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,429
Yo, I was a kid...

265
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,119
...when I drew all these.

266
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,750
It was like four years ago.

267
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,558
-They all look like you.
-What?

268
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,475
It's you in all of these.

269
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,713
No.

270
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,798
I wonder what a shrink would say
if he saw them.

271
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,070
Oh, shut up.

272
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,236
Like you never wanted
a superpower.

273
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,516
-Is that your door or mine?
-I don't know.

274
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,597
It sounds like mine.

275
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,396
-I gotta go.
-Where?

276
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,394
Hey, where?

277
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,356
Hey, hold up. Where are you...?

278
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,879
Jane.

279
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,753
Jane.

280
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,875
-Hey, Dad.
-There you are.

281
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,233
Hi, honey.

282
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,273
I saw your car, so I was
pretty sure you were home.

283
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,478
Yeah, sorry. I was working.
I had my headphones on.

284
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,796
Finally realised that
I wasn't the drum track?

285
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,395
-Exactly.
-Well, I was in the neighbourhood.

286
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,239
Was wondering if you wanted
to grab some lunch.

287
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,634
Sure. Yeah.

288
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,353
Hey, this your dad?

289
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,193
-Yes.
-Hello.

290
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,594
Hi.

291
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,438
This is the new tenant.

292
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,154
-Donald.
-Jesse.

293
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,595
I'm sorry. Did you need something?

294
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,112
-No.
-Dad, why don't you come in?

295
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,833
It was nice seeing you.

296
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,873
-It was nice to meet you.
-You too.

297
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,639
Hey, Dad.

298
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,589
-Hey, son. Are you home early?
-No.

299
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,318
Oh, man.

300
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,790
It was a good day?

301
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,836
Now it is. Finally, hot water.
No more toxic waste.

302
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,951
Yes. Yes, indeed.

303
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,516
Top of the line, on demand,
unlimited supply.

304
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,039
-Sweet.
-Yeah.

305
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,153
-Hey, want to take her for a spin?
-Oh, yeah.

306
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,916
Listen, why don't you
go to the kitchen sink?

307
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,192
Let me know when you're ready,
and I'll give you a holler.

308
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,913
Okay.

309
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,718
Pilot in.

310
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,480
Ignition. Bingo.

311
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,193
Okay.

312
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,633
-Ready.
-All right. Let her rip.

313
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,311
Hundred and seventeen
thousand BTUs.

314
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,431
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

315
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,949
Built-in corrosion-resistant
draught reducer...

316
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,515
...safety thermocouple
with the pilot burner.

317
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,711
Sounds really good, Dad.

318
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,998
And the energy savings. I mean....

319
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,236
Oh, careful, careful, careful.

320
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,113
There's probably some adjustments
I need to make. You okay?

321
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,834
-Yeah, I'm fine.
-Okay.

322
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,359
Son...

323
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,795
-...about yesterday--
-I'm sorry about the pool.

324
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,068
No, no, no, that was not your fault.
Not at all.

325
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,879
See, your....

326
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,556
Your old man embarrassed himself...

327
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,910
...and I'm not very proud
of my behaviour.

328
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,749
I have to say I feel very foolish.

329
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,194
You and Uncle Hank,
you seemed pissed off.

330
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,597
No. No. We're fine.
Everything's fine.

331
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,509
I called him this morning
and made my apologies.

332
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:39,750
But, son, I owe you
an apology most of all.

333
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,473
I should have used
better judgement all around.

334
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,512
Having you drink in the first place,
it was not right...

335
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,790
...and for that I'm very sorry.

336
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,158
But I kept up, right?

337
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,994
You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.

338
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,196
I have some tools to put away.

339
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,159
Hey.

340
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,395
Yo.

341
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,670
You want to catch a movie later?

342
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,353
Yo.

343
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,751
-What?
-What was that all about?

344
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,954
What?

345
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,470
Before. With your dad.

346
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,113
It wasn't about anything.

347
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,155
Oh, okay, so I totally
just misread your total dis?

348
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,510
If anything, I was doing you a favour.

349
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,233
A favour?

350
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,030
Yeah, I told you. He's a hard-ass.

351
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,834
-He seemed cool to me.
-Yeah, well.

352
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,237
-So, what's the deal?
-There's no deal.

353
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,637
I was helping you out, okay?
Protecting you.

354
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,273
-How's that?
-I mean...

355
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,393
...I'm letting you smoke in here
and everything.

356
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,549
I bought a filter.

357
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,035
And I figured
the less he knows, the better.

358
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,155
You acted like
you didn't even know me.

359
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,759
So?

360
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,277
-So?
-You think I'm gonna be all like:

361
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,436
"Dad, meet the stoner guy
who lives next door.

362
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,995
And by the way,
I'm sleeping with him"?

363
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,633
That's all you think you're doing?

364
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,350
-Why do you even care about my dad?
-I don't.

365
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,755
Good. Then I don't know
why we're talking about it.

366
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,430
Us. All right? I'm talking about us.

367
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,949
-Us.
-Yeah.

368
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,075
You and me.

369
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,910
Who's you and me?

370
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,033
I'm out of here.

371
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,159
Oh, boy.

372
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,393
Dad?

373
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,869
Dad? Hello?

374
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,198
What? Oh, hey.

375
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,148
-What are you doing?
-We've got rot.

376
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,874
-Rot?
-Yeah. Here.

377
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,389
I'll show you. Here.

378
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,589
Take a look at that.

379
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,838
See that? Yeah.
Ever seen anything like it?

380
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,635
-It's wood.
-It's wood...

381
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,478
...that contains fruiting bodies.

382
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,309
Fruity what?

383
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,633
Fungus. And it is on a rampage.

384
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,796
I don't really see anything.

385
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,310
Yeah, well, it's there. You just have
to know where to look. Here.

386
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,031
Then you cut it all out.

387
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,551
You just cut it out and start fresh.

388
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,200
Well, better get to it.

389
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,358
Is the whole house
gonna collapse or something?

390
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,917
Not if I can help it.

391
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,715
Hey. You bucking for a promotion?

392
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,630
-Go home already.
-I will. I will.

393
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,189
Hey, can I just ask...

394
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,754
-...the Keller account?
-The Keller account?

395
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,475
It's listed as a current asset
on this balance sheet...

396
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,559
...but the invoice was never presented
to accounts receivable, so....

397
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,749
Oh, God.

398
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,032
One of these days I'm gonna just
sort through all the Dad stuff.

399
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,391
He had so many "Don't worry about it,
pay me Friday" relationships...

400
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,511
...with these little companies.

401
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,157
We'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not.

402
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,553
Right.

403
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,113
Seriously, you're not gonna
make me lock you in, are you?

404
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,193
Sky?

405
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,315
Skyler?

406
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,078
Jesus.

407
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,356
No, I'm fine.

408
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,439
It's hormones. Honestly.
It happens all the time.

409
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,352
I'll see you tomorrow.

410
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,559
What's wrong?

411
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,792
I guess it just...

412
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,750
...doesn't feel any different.

413
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,952
The good news?

414
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,073
I mean, nothing's really changed.

415
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,756
It's just postponed.

416
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,558
There was supposed to be a light
at the end of the tunnel.

417
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,955
But lately, it just feels like....

418
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,398
More tunnel.

419
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,552
I'm sorry.

420
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,954
I just feel so damn ungrateful.

421
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,631
I don't know.

422
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,112
For me, it was the flu.

423
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,831
-What?
-My dad rallied at the end.

424
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,315
I mean, it wasn't the full-on
good news Walt got...

425
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,954
...different circumstances,
but we were happy...

426
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,718
...we were over the moon.

427
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,037
And right then, I got sick.

428
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,114
Flu.
Knocked me on my ass for days.

429
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,073
Couldn't get out of bed,
I couldn't move.

430
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:29,034
-Great timing, huh?
-Yeah.

431
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,875
And I wasn't even putting two
and two together. I was just thinking:

432
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,593
"Why now?"

433
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,437
Being that rock.

434
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,959
You know...

435
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:47,678
...being that rock
takes everything you got.

436
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,199

1
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,637
Okay. That's okay.

2
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,639
Get that.

3
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,033
Hey.

4
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,076
-Oh, God. Please.
-Oh, jeez.

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,633
Please.

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,068
Please.

7
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,839
It's a bold plan, Mr. White.

8
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,758
You sure this is the way to go?

9
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,114
Yeah.

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,594
Yeah.

11
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,235
You see that?

12
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,040
-What does he remember?
-Not a whole lot.

13
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,992
He came in dehydrated
and disoriented...

14
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,794
...but once we gave him fluids
he stabilised pretty quickly.

15
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,069
But I mean....

16
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,511
-He knows where he is?
-Oh, yes, yes. Absolutely.

17
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,917
It's only the last day or so
that seem to be missing.

18
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,588
Go on in. He's probably awake.

19
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,953
My God.

20
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,118
Walter.

21
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,798
I'm so sorry.

22
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,349
Come here.

23
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,755
You know who I am, right?

24
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,999
Yes, son. I know who you are.

25
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,919
Come here. Give your old man a hug.

26
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,788
It's so good to see you.

27
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,711
How do you feel?

28
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,194
Better.

29
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,152
Yeah. I....

30
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,510
I feel like myself.

31
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,631
Really, I mean, in....

32
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,715
The past couple days are missing,
but other than that...

33
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,909
...I feel fine.

34
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,031
My God, Walt.

35
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,430
What a day this has been.

36
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,632
So, Uncle Hank,
he was in a shootout?

37
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,874
A shootout?

38
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,913
He killed some guy.
Some big drug dealer.

39
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,075
Uncle Hank wasted him.

40
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,840
-Oh, my God. Is he all right?
-Absolutely fine.

41
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,669
-Where did this happen? How could--?
-Walt, everything's okay.

42
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,155
We're all okay.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,955
We'll be all right.

44
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,674
<i>And no idea what caused it?</i>

45
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,029
No.

46
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,073
But they're gonna run
a whole series of tests, so....

47
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,068
<i>But what could it be? I mean, did they</i>
<i>give you a worst-case scenario?</i>

48
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,318
I really....

49
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,872
You know, there's no point
in getting ahead of ourselves, so....

50
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,513
Well, which supermarket?

51
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,632
Is it, like, a big one? Like, a chain?

52
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,434
-Marie.
<i>-I.... Don't get me wrong.</i>

53
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,430
I think it's just great that, you know,
he's back and he's feeling better.

54
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,358
I just, I mean....

55
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,030
He.... Naked?

56
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,913
He was naked.

57
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,792
Naked.

58
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,513
In a supermarket.

59
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,039
It wasn't Whole Foods, was it?

60
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,429
<i>In any case, I'm gonna get over there</i>
<i>as soon as I can.</i>

61
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,552
No, no. Don't worry about it
right now, Marie.

62
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,113
How's Hank?

63
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,754
You know, I ran over here
and I got to see him all of...

64
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,111
...30 seconds
before they yanked him away.

65
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,039
You know, you'd think today
of all days...

66
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,232
...they'd let him go home on time.

67
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,511
But how is he? Really?

68
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,068
Hank?

69
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,234
He's indestructible, you know that.

70
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,591
I identified myself and told the suspect
to show his hands, turn and face me.

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,360
At this point, I identified
the suspect as Mr. Salamanca...

72
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,711
...and observed what appeared to be
a gunshot wound in his midsection.

73
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,356
-He was shot previous to your arrival?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,030
Again I instructed him
to show his hands.

75
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,310
Mr. Salamanca lunged
toward the vehicle...

76
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,910
...and fired on me with what I
ascertained to be an M1 6 assault rifle.

77
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,076
I returned fire and sought cover...

78
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,192
...as Mr. Salamanca proceeded
to engage me.

79
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,914
When he paused to reload...

80
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,391
...I was able to take
an effective shot.

81
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,834
Agent Schrader...

82
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,316
...what were you doing in a shooting
fight on your own, with no backup?

83
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,114
Mr. Salamanca's presence
was not something I'd anticipated.

84
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,788
-I was tending to another matter.
-What other matter?

85
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,678
An unrelated family matter.

86
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,793
Searching for your brother-in-law,
as I understand.

87
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,358
-Your brother-in-law?
-Yes, sir. He's since been found.

88
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,199
He's fine. The whole thing
was a misunderstanding.

89
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,231
At the time, he'd been missing
for hours...

90
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,796
...and since he's in poor health,
the whole family was concerned.

91
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,831
I was talking to his acquaintances...

92
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,190
...trying to get a fix
on his whereabouts.

93
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,836
The Monte Carlo at the scene
belonged to a former student of his...

94
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,032
...a Jesse Pinkman.

95
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,631
I was tracking down Mr. Pinkman's car
when I came across Mr. Salamanca.

96
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,957
And what about this Pinkman? What
was his car doing at the crime scene?

97
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,709
-Have you run him down yet?
-Not yet, but we're working on it.

98
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,428
Man, they're like
Jehovah's Witnesses.

99
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,993
They don't give up.

100
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,315
I don't get it. Why don't they
kick your door down?

101
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,671
-They need probable cause.
-Probable cause?

102
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,598
Yo, what did you do? Rob a bank?

103
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,031
I told you, this is serious shit.

104
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,197
I'm like an outlaw.

105
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,515
Okay.

106
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,038
Let's do this.

107
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,913
Holy Christ!

108
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,475
You're Willy Wonka.

109
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,319
You are Willy Wonka,
and I got the golden ticket.

110
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,473
Put me on your magical boat, man.

111
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,672
Sail me down
your chocolaty river of meth.

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,154
So where you keep the pseudo?

113
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,955
It's a P2P cook. That barrel?
Aqueous methylamine.

114
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,675
With that, you don't need pseudo.
Come on, help me out, man.

115
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,552
No pseudo?

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,788
Come to me, beautiful baby.
I'm gonna be so good to you.

117
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,554
Oh, my God. Just take this, here.

118
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,309
But I can't just let you
break this down.

119
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,034
-That'd be sacrilege.
-I told you, that's why we're here.

120
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,798
-You saw the cops. Right?
-Sure.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,230
But couldn't we just
cook one quick batch?

122
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,079
-You know, for the road?
-No, forget it, all right?

123
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,955
-This stuff has to go, like, now.
-Dude, you owe me.

124
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,637
I mean, we're cool, but I ain't
forgetting you just left me stranded.

125
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,353
God, Badger!

126
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,996
Don't mess with me.

127
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,516
Got it?

128
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,919
Yeah, I got it.

129
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,432
Oh, my God.

130
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,794
Okay, that's all of it.

131
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,559
This was a bad choice.

132
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,438
You sure about this guy?

133
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,710
He's totally, totally cool.

134
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,592
He's my cousin.

135
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,915
-Yo, what'd we say, 500?
-We didn't say, and it's 1 000.

136
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,439
Thousand bucks?

137
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,200
Come on, where you towing it,
man, Seattle?

138
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,118
It ain't the miles, it's the cargo.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,798
Look, I mean, all I got on me is...

140
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,628
...560.

141
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,833
-You know what?
-Hey-- No--

142
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,793
Clovis, he'll pay you the rest later.

143
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,356
He's totally good for it.
Jesse's a stand-up dude.

144
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,553
-That right? You a stand-up dude?
-Yeah, I am.

145
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,876
I will get you the other 500.

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,195
Five hundred more.

147
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,511
Your word's your bond, right?

148
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,479
Right.

149
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,312
I saved your skinny ass, yo.
I totally vouched for you.

150
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,434
What are you doing now, exactly?

151
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,438
I'm giving you, like, two hours...

152
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,950
...and then I'm calling on a pay phone,
not a cell phone.

153
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,639
You're not using your own name.

154
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,436
I mean, obviously. Look, dude, I'll do,
like, what you said, but why?

155
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,596
Why do you gotta go and do this?

156
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,350
They need probable cause.

157
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,834
I'm giving it to them.

158
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,475
What's the last thing
you remember?

159
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,030
Well, I was driving home.

160
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,788
I think.

161
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,315
And....

162
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,679
Do you remember coming home?

163
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,875
You came in, and I asked
why you were out of breath?

164
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,349
You don't remember talking to me
when I was in the bathtub?

165
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,872
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

166
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,200
-Nothing else? No fleeting images?
-Well, no. I....

167
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,629
I was--

168
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:13,154
I was walking down some road
or highway...

169
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,395
...with a lot of headlights...

170
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,559
...and I remember feeling fear.

171
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,633
-That's it.
-All right. Thank you.

172
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,718
Well, there's definitely
some good news here.

173
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,309
The MRI shows no metastases.

174
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,273
Meaning the cancer
hasn't spread to the brain?

175
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,232
Yeah, we're looking really good.

176
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,112
Oh, thank God.

177
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,876
So, what was it, then?

178
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,311
-There's no sign of stroke or seizure.
-And considering your condition...

179
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,112
...the blood panel looks good.

180
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,313
Then what are we talking about?
What happened?

181
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,638
As of right now, we really...

182
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,159
...can't say.

183
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,634
Forgive me.
Granted, this is not my field...

184
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,354
...but isn't it possible
that this had something to do...

185
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,596
...with all the prescriptions
I've been taking?

186
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,279
There's the antiemetic...

187
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,232
...the antitussive...

188
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,796
...the this, the that.
Not to mention the chemo itself.

189
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,078
And being off all of them
for the past few days, I have to say...

190
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,077
...I'm feeling much better.

191
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,748
Yeah, and, you know, when we pick up
these medications...

192
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,349
...the information sheets
are as long as your arm.

193
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,394
I mean, it's page after page
of side effects and warnings.

194
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,672
Right, exactly.
Could it be that simple?

195
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,429
Well, we'll take
another look at that, sure.

196
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,393
Walt, I understand that you've been
kind of stressed out lately.

197
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,513
Stressed out? I--

198
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,631
-No, I don't think I'm--
-Walt, please.

199
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,035
Stressed out is putting it...

200
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,434
...mildly.

201
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,918
Well, I guess I've had a lot
on my mind lately, but as I've said...

202
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,712
...I'm feeling much better.

203
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,480
Shouldn't we be talking
about when I can get out of here?

204
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,478
Well, that may still be
a ways down the road.

205
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,119
A ways down the road?

206
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,313
Actually, I think our next move
is to schedule a psychiatric evaluation.

207
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,517
Now, is that absolutely necessary?

208
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,950
Nobody likes being in the hospital.
I get that.

209
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,316
But until we know
what caused this incident...

210
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,795
...we can't be certain it won't recur.

211
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,832
-That your last hit?
-Yeah.

212
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,235
Finish it quick.

213
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,631
Show your hands.
Get on your stomach now.

214
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,674
Get on your stomach now!
Get over. Roll! Do it now!

215
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,397
I'm going, I'm going.

216
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,314
What's going on?

217
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,431
What did I do?

218
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,158
Jesse Pinkman, I presume.

219
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,560
-What, man?
-Tell me again.

220
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,755
Again?

221
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,679
What's there to tell, okay?
Her and I were partying, that's it.

222
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,713
Since Saturday night?
Partying for three days straight.

223
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,117
Just bumping uglies and smoking that
crystal you got from your pal, Tuco?

224
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,639
Taco? I don't know any Taco...

225
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,308
...and I damn sure didn't say
anything about no crystal.

226
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,078
Three days,
you must have got hungry.

227
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,474
Yeah, I guess.

228
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,875
-You order take-out?
-Yeah.

229
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,991
Yeah, where from?

230
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,715
You get yourself a little
of that moo goo gai pan...

231
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,956
...from that chink place
around the corner?

232
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,709
No, no, we didn't. We got stuff
from the vending machine.

233
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,478
You know, Funyuns.

234
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,079
I had a Hot Pocket.

235
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,669
Funyuns and Hot Pockets?

236
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,438
You didn't notice your car
was gone?

237
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,074
No, not until you guys went
and busted down the door.

238
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,271
Now, who's gonna pay for that, huh?

239
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,436
Management's gonna
be on my ass for sure.

240
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,473
-You weren't answering your phone.
-It was in my car.

241
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,352
-That right?
-Yeah.

242
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,235
We found your car...

243
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,476
...but your phone wasn't in it.

244
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,113
You found my car?

245
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,273
You found my car?

246
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,677
Awesome. DEA all the way. Yes.

247
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,228
Since we're talking
about missing property, did you...?

248
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,954
Did you leave anything else
in the car?

249
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,229
Like what?

250
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,718
Like what? Like....

251
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,150
I don't know. Like this?

252
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,953
Sixty-seven thousand, nine hundred
and 20 dollars.

253
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,718
That's not mine.

254
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,638
That's not yours?

255
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,515
He says it's not his, Gomie.

256
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,950
Gee, I really thought
this might be yours.

257
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,596
-I wish.
-Unclaimed drug money, huh? Nice.

258
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,791
You know what we got here,
Gomie, don't you?

259
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,753
That's a new interdiction van
right there, yeah.

260
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,349
Definitely new softball jerseys,
because we need them.

261
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,152
Good thing Tuco's already dead.

262
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,669
I lost this kind of money,
I'd wanna kill myself.

263
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,076
So who's your chief, little Injun?

264
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,713
What?

265
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,798
-What does that even mean?
-I think your story's bullshit.

266
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,355
I think you know
who Tuco Salamanca was.

267
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,391
Your car was there
because you were there.

268
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,708
Tuco had a bullet in him when I
got there and you know about that too.

269
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,676
So, what are you saying?

270
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,711
I shot someone?

271
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,230
-With, like, a gun?
-You?

272
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,233
No.

273
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,398
Only shooting you do
is into a Kleenex.

274
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,596
But I think you know
the badass who did.

275
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,032
Look, I was partying with Wendy,
okay?

276
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,354
Funyuns and boom-boom.

277
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,513
No.

278
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,472
I don't think so.

279
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,671
Tell you what. We're gonna...

280
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,714
...go talk to that skinny yeast factory
of a girlfriend you got.

281
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,512
And you know what?

282
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,309
I got a feeling she's gonna, you know,
roll on you.

283
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,597
Don't go nowhere.

284
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,674
Where's my root beer? Come on.
I gotta pee, and I got low blood sugar.

285
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,792
-I got medical issues.
-Medical issues?

286
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,877
Like, what kind of medical issues?

287
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,672
You got penis withdrawal?

288
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,110
You got schlongus interruptus?

289
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,235
Wendy, listen. Talk to me...

290
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,192
...and you get a root beer
and a tinkle.

291
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,277
-Tell me the last three days.
-I told you...

292
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,914
...we were shacked up
since Saturday.

293
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,192
Neither of you left the room?
Not even for a little, little minute?

294
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,758
Not even for a second?

295
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,914
For a second? I don't know, maybe.

296
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,792
Maybe?

297
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,672
Did Jesse leave the room?

298
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,472
He did, didn't he?

299
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,913
Wendy, you can do it.
You can do it, Wendy.

300
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,240
Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

301
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,917
You know you wanna go back
to giving windys, Wendy.

302
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,915
It's you. I know you.

303
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,317
You're the one in the black truck.
You wanted me to do that kid.

304
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,192
-What?
-The kid with the crutches.

305
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,595
-The football player.
-How about we stay on topic?

306
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,713
Look, Jesse came over to the palace
at 11:00 Saturday night.

307
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,593
We were together the whole time,
and he never left the room.

308
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,438
And that's all I'm saying about that.

309
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,149
Now, come on.

310
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,430
Where's my root beer?

311
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,830
You wanted her to bang
a football player, pervert?

312
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,473
It's a long story, Gomie.

313
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,036
I'm sure it is, and I wanna hear it,
but first we gotta kick Pinkman loose.

314
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,277
Not yet. I got one more shot
at that little skid mark.

315
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,190
And how are you sleeping?

316
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,835
Fine. Most nights.

317
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,275
Good.

318
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,755
Have you noticed
any recurring thoughts or images...

319
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,996
...things you can't
get out of your head?

320
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,349
How about feelings of guilt
or persecution?

321
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,189
No. Look, doctor,
I don't mean to be rude...

322
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,233
...but where is this going, exactly?

323
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,671
We're starting a process, Walt.
An ongoing process.

324
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,429
-Do you prefer Walt or Walter?
-Ongoing for how long?

325
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,868
I just met you. Hard to say.

326
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,958
We could be talking about days,
weeks, months.

327
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,030
Look, doctor, I feel fine, really.

328
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,468
Now...

329
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,754
...if this is truly necessary,
can't I continue as an outpatient?

330
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,476
Walt...

331
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:17,070
...a fugue state
is a very serious event.

332
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,316
What if you were to disassociate
while driving?

333
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,555
Get into a situation...

334
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,591
...where you could be shot
by the police?

335
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,392
We can't allow you to leave...

336
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,558
...until we're certain what happened
was a non-recurring event.

337
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,399
Saying you feel fine
doesn't solve this.

338
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,873
Would you tell me
about patient confidentiality?

339
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,195
It's very straightforward.

340
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,631
Without your permission,
I can't disclose anything to anyone.

341
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,068
What about my family?

342
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,477
Not your family, not to the police.
Not to anyone.

343
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,194
The exception would be
if you threatened to kill someone.

344
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,915
Then I'd be able to tell that person,
but only that person.

345
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,591
And you, as a medical practitioner...

346
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,870
...you abide
by these strictures absolutely.

347
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,354
Yes.

348
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,515
All right.

349
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,071
There was no fugue state.

350
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,831
I remember everything.

351
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,236
The truth is...

352
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,910
...I couldn't stand to spend
another second in that house.

353
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,396
I just had to get out...

354
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,195
...and so I left.

355
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,470
I didn't think about it.
I just did it.

356
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:41,789
I walked for a long time, and when I
couldn't walk anymore, I hitchhiked.

357
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,313
I got as far as Gallup...

358
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,598
...and then it was just time
to come home.

359
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,313
So...

360
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,239
...being found naked
in a supermarket...

361
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,830
...that was your way
of giving credibility to a lie?

362
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,112
Of avoiding questions
about your disappearance?

363
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,118
Why run away?

364
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,232
What did you feel
you had to run from?

365
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,031
Doctor, my wife
is seven months pregnant...

366
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,151
...with a baby we didn't intend.

367
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,630
My 15-year-old son
has cerebral palsy.

368
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,992
I am an extremely overqualified
high school chemistry teacher.

369
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,796
When I can work,
I make $43,700 per year.

370
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,956
I have watched
all of my colleagues...

371
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:43,435
...and friends surpass me
in every way imaginable...

372
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,349
...and within 18 months,
I will be dead.

373
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,789
And you ask why I ran?

374
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,993
Gomie, you wanna do the honours?

375
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,798
-What's that mean?
-That means yes.

376
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,834
-Yes is a bell, no is no bell.
-Come on, this is bullshit.

377
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,510
I mean, look at this dude. He doesn't
even know what planet he's living on.

378
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,119
Señor...

379
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,358
...are we on the planet Mars?

380
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,792
Are we on the planet Saturn?

381
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,678
Are we on the planet Earth?

382
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,232
Señor, is today Friday?

383
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,999
Is today Monday?

384
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,633
Is today Tuesday?

385
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,828
Okay, seems like he's all there.
Let's go for it.

386
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,035
Señor...

387
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,279
...was this man
at your house yesterday?

388
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,871
Señor, was this man
at your house yesterday?

389
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,198
This guy right here,
he was at your house, right?

390
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,550
Was he doing business
with your nephew Tuco?

391
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,194
Señor, are you scared of this man?

392
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,035
No, he's not scared.

393
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,750
Come on, Granddad.

394
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,110
Don't you wanna help us out?

395
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,756
Oh, man.

396
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,399
I guess that's a no.

397
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,194
-I told you, numbnuts. This guy's OG.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

398
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,436
Kept his mouth shut for 17 years
in San Quentin.

399
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,552
Stroke or no stroke, old-school
gangbang Mexicans don't help feds.

400
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,639
-All right. It was worth a try at least.
-We gotta kick Pinkman loose.

401
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,671
It's all right. He's nobody anyway.

402
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,871
You telling me you buy
that lame-ass story?

403
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,231
I buy that lame-ass story more than
I buy he had anything to do...

404
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,431
...with shooting Tuco, man.

405
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,714
Dad? Hey, Dad.

406
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,638
Hey, can you hear me?

407
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,353
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Hey, I'm....

408
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,755
What's--?

409
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,793
She did?
No, I didn't get any messages.

410
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,672
You know, I actually...

411
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,519
...lost my phone, and I've been
too busy to get a new one.

412
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,869
I've been busy as....

413
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,877
As totally productive.

414
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:18,231
Hey, you know what?
I'm actually zeroing in on a job.

415
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,591
Yeah, yeah, data entry,
like we talked about.

416
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,155
Yeah, I'm totally amped.

417
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,590
Hey, could you give me a ride?

418
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,032
I'm actually--
I'm downtown and my car's in the....

419
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,631
Oh, no.
Yeah, hey, that's cool. I will--

420
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,389
I'll call you later
when you have some....

421
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,031
Okay. Yeah. No. I--

422
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,754
I get it. I get it.

423
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,235
Okay, bye.

424
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,072
Thanks.

425
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,919
So, what are you doing now?

426
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,997
Waffle House?

427
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,268
Waffle House is good.

428
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,515
Pay phone?

429
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,280
Pay phone, in the middle of nowhere,
nobody followed.

430
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,435
So how did it go?

431
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,719
Okay. You?

432
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,038
They sweated me plenty,
but they finally cut me loose.

433
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,476
-So you getting out of there?
-Tomorrow.

434
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,591
So who came for you?

435
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,472
The DEA? What did they ask you?

436
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,990
Yeah, that's the thing, you know.
Your scumbag brother-in-law...

437
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,679
...took my rainy-day fund.

438
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,598
<i>Your what? What is that?</i>

439
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,917
My rainy-day fund.
Sixty-eight thousand, okay?

440
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,951
Cue-ball son of a bitch
laughed in my face.

441
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,991
Now I got like 80 bucks
to my name.

442
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,519
Wait, wait. What does he know?

443
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,233
Does he know it's your money?

444
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,829
No, man.
He doesn't know shit, okay?

445
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,519
The plan worked.

446
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,869
They bought it.

447
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,435
I got bills due, man. I'm screwed.

448
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,599
-Did he mention my name?
<i>-No. Thanks for caring.</i>

449
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,474
-What about the basement?
-It's clean.

450
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,557
<i>And the RV?</i>

451
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,435
Badger's cousin took it to his garage.
It's safe.

452
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,870
Can he get it running again?

453
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,548
<i>-Why?</i>
-So we can cook.

454
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,392
So you still wanna cook?

455
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,999
Seriously?

456
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,790
What's changed, Jesse?

457
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,314
Seven-hundred
thirty-seven thousand.

458
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,397
Twenty-one pounds...

459
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,830
...minus cash on hand....

460
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,709
Cash on hand.

461
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,318
-Sorry, honey. Did I wake you?
-No, I was awake.

462
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,432
-Want some cornflakes?
-Yeah, sure.

463
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,515
-You okay?
-Yeah.

464
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,031
Southwest Aniline again?

465
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,395
What's this?

466
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,830
It's the blue meth we found
up by your late homey.

467
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,350
Tuco wasn't my homey, any more
than Charlie Manson was yours.

468
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,790
Lab says it got cooked, P2P-style.

469
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,231
P2P, huh?

470
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,919
So, what are you thinking?

471
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,917
The two stooges over here
cooked it?

472
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,917
Lab said that blue meth's
the purest they've seen.

473
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,553
At least since this.

474
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,270
-Krazy-8.
-Yeah.

475
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,318
Krazy-8, Tuco....

476
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,077
Somehow, some way,
it's all connected.

477
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,990
A simple explanation...

478
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,634
...only I'm not seeing it,
and it's making my head hurt.

479
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,274
That's because you're working
that ugly melon too hard.

480
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,675
It's dead around here.
Let's get a couple of beers.

481
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,713
It's 11 in the morning.

482
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,875
I'm buying.

483
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,274
You're buying? Holy crap.

484
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,199
-What, is it Cinco de Mayo already?
-Oh, yeah.

485
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,795
Surprise.

486
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,552
You little sneaky bastard, you.

487
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,314
Very nice work.

488
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,474
Thank you, sir.

489
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,869
-What's this?
-Look what we got you.

490
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,075
-Look at that, I love it.
-They got the gut right.

491
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,236
-Hey.
-There you go.

492
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,998
-Hey, thanks, man.
-Thank you.

493
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,749
We all got you a little something,
and this is from all of us.

494
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,837
You shouldn't have.

495
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,996
Oh, you sick, sick puppies.

496
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,838
I love it.

497
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,631
You going to finish
your apple juice?

498
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,518
No, thanks, buddy. You take it.

499
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,952
You're supposed to drink it.

500
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,436
The nurse said
you have to stay hydrated.

501
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,598
But I'm not thirsty.

502
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,917
Dad. Drink it.

503
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,318
Hey.

504
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,192
Better late than never, huh?

505
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,231
-Hey.
-Hey.

506
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,958
How you doing, buddy?
You all right?

507
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,116
I see
the mark of the beast there, huh?

508
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,390
Oh, yeah.
Marie stopped by this morning.

509
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,353
They really cheer the place up.

510
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,394
Hey, I ran into Sky downstairs.

511
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,910
They're rounding up a wheelchair
for you, you freeloading bastard.

512
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,073
So tell us about the shootout.

513
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,477
I was, you know, just doing my job.

514
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,035
Whole thing was over
in about five seconds.

515
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,071
Say, Walt, you know...

516
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,874
...how are you?

517
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,754
I'm okay.

518
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,428
Really, I'm feeling fine.

519
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,830
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Yeah.

520
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,759
The doctor is calling it a....

521
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,839
An isolated episode of
transient global amnesia.

522
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,519
Damn.

523
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,278
Which means non-recurring.

524
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,550
Non-recurring.
That sounds good, yeah.

525
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,113
Sounds real good.

526
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,790
I'll tell you what, I'm glad you're back.
You really gave us a scare.

527
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,719
Listen, Hank.

528
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,153
I don't know what to say. I mean...

529
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:13,037
...you going out there looking for me
put you in danger, and I'm so....

530
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,755
Sorry, sorry doesn't
even cut it. Not nearly.

531
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,428
No, no, no. Is that what you're
worried about? Forget it.

532
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,916
Look, the office, they're treating me
like I'm Eliot Ness, okay?

533
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,271
They threw me a party, the gals
baked me a chocolate-chip cake...

534
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,391
...like you wouldn't believe, okay?

535
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,637
You ought to disappear more often.

536
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,115
Just kidding. Don't do that.

537
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,876
Hey, look.
Look what they gave me.

538
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,593
Look what they gave me.

539
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,994
What is it?

540
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:44,478
That, gentlemen,
is the grill of the guy I shot.

541
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,799
-His grill?
-Yeah.

542
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,468
It kind of goes over the front teeth
like that, you know?

543
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,875
Sort of a fashion statement, I guess.

544
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,594
You know, certain folks
are attracted to shiny things.

545
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,518
Wow, cool.

546
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,675
Yeah.

547
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,279
I can't tell you how good it feels
to be home.

548
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,037
I'll get these in the wash.

549
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,514
Okay.

550
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,710
Say, honey, I....

551
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,675
I was just thinking about going out
to 7-Eleven. Do you need anything?

552
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,989
Big Gulp? Slim Jim?

553
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,590
Skyler, listen to me.

554
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,953
This will not happen again, okay?

555
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,229
I won't let it.

556
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,789
I'm still here. I'm me...

557
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,235
...and we're gonna be okay.

558
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,512
Walt...

559
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,157
...do you have a second cell phone?

560
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,793
A second cell phone?

561
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,039
The night you disappeared, you came
in when I was taking a bath...

562
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,231
...and you were very upset.

563
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,838
It was like something
terrible had happened.

564
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,759
And then your cell phone rang.

565
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,077
I saw you check the number,
and then you got up...

566
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,635
...and just disappeared.

567
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,719
Yeah.

568
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,115
And when Hank
checked your phone records...

569
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,198
...there was no call.

570
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,950
No call on the phone I know about.

571
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,198
That is...

572
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,038
...odd.

573
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,069
I mean, I don't remember
any of that...

574
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,035
...but one thing I am sure of is that
I don't have a second cell phone.

575
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,159
Okay.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

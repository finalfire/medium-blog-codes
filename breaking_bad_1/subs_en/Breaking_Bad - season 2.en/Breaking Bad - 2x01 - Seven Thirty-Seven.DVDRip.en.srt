1
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,790
What is this? It's blue.

2
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,679
We used a different chemical process,
but it is every bit as pure.

3
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,838
It may be blue, but it's the bomb.

4
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,072
Tight, tight, tight. Yeah.

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,916
Blue, yellow, pink, whatever, man,
just keep bringing me that.

6
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,477
You're all right. We're gonna make
a lot of money together.

7
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,278
Just remember
who you're working for.

8
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,592
What did you say?

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,473
I'm just saying, they gotta know
that they're working for you.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,150
Like they don't already know that?

11
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,873
Are you saying that they're stupid?

12
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,074
No, I'm just saying.

13
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,794
Okay, so you're not saying
that they're stupid?

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,514
So I don't understand.
Are you saying that I'm stupid?

15
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,073
Is that it?

16
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,191
Is that what you're doing?

17
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,437
Tuco. Tuco.

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,679
Hey, why don't we all
just relax, huh?

19
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,470
Heisenberg says relax.

20
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,271
I'm relaxed. I'm relaxed. I'm rela--

21
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,474
Damn, man! Look at that! Look!

22
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,595
Yeah, that's messed up.

23
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,072
Okay, Heisenberg. Next week.

24
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,030
Adjusting for inflation....

25
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,834
Good state college,
adjusting for inflation...

26
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,473
...say, $45,000 a year.

27
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,391
Two kids, four years of college,
$360,000.

28
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,434
Remaining mortgage on the home,
107,000.

29
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,553
Home equity line, 30,000.
That's 137,000.

30
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,389
Cost of living, food, clothing,
utilities...

31
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,593
...say, 2 grand a month.

32
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,156
I mean, that should put a dent in it,
anyway.

33
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,957
Twenty-four K a year,
provide for, say, 10 years.

34
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,439
That's $240,000.
Plus 360, plus 137.

35
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,390
Seven thirty-seven.

36
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,359
Seven hundred and thirty-seven
thousand. That's what I need.

37
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,755
That is what I need.

38
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,199
You and I both clear
about 70 grand a week.

39
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,119
That's only 10 and half more weeks.
Call it 11.

40
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,632
Eleven more drug deals, and always
in a public place from now on.

41
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,790
It's doable. Definitely doable.

42
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,154
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

43
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,229
Heisenberg!

44
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
What the hell?
What's wrong with him?

45
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,748
What's the matter with you?

46
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,157
You can't take an ass-beating, bitch?

47
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,952
-Oh, damn, Tuco.
-Shut up!

48
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,316
There's no pulse.

49
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,875
-Do something.
-Do something?

50
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,310
He needs an ambulance.
He needs a hospital.

51
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,795
Do something! You're smart, right?

52
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,274
Do that-- Do that thing.

53
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,518
No, there's not-- There's nothing.

54
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,073
Breathe into his mouth.

55
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,475
No, they don't teach that anymore.
It doesn't work.

56
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,195
You, come here.
Breathe into his mouth.

57
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,672
No.

58
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,594
Get rid of him.

59
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,836
Look, Tuco,
we can't do him like that, man.

60
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,758
Buzzards and rats and all that.

61
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,475
I'm just saying, you know?
It's not very Christian.

62
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,479
That sounds like arguing.

63
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,236
Gonzo, hurry up.

64
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,115
What's the big hurry?

65
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,393
Oh, I.... I just think we're done here.

66
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,397
Oh, yeah?

67
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,391
You're done.

68
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,674
Hey, I'm back here.

69
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,397
Hello?

70
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,195
<i>Are already married--</i>

71
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,753
Hello?

72
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,591
<i>Thank you to our viewers--</i>

73
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,631
Hey.

74
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,516
<i>The crash happened</i>
<i>as rush hour began around 8 a.m.</i>

75
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,273
Walt?

76
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,429
Didn't you hear me?

77
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,349
Walt.

78
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,398
Walt.

79
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,629
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

80
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,990
What, you can't answer
when I'm calling you?

81
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,597
Are you okay?

82
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,872
Great.

83
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,195
New hat?

84
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,033
Yeah.

85
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,872
I got some chicken at Albertson's.

86
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,832
Do you want me to heat
some up for you?

87
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,749
<i>But they can occasionally adapt</i>
<i>to other local areas...</i>

88
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,316
<i>...like airports, golf courses--</i>

89
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,836
Where've you been?

90
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,438
What is...?

91
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,309
What are you doing?

92
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,478
Okay.

93
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,670
You know what?
I've got all this crap on my face.

94
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,791
Let me clean up first, okay?

95
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,834
You know, Walter Junior's
gonna be home any minute, so....

96
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,838
Okay. Yeah, just....

97
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,395
Okay. Enough.

98
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,556
Hold up. Stop it.

99
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,795
Stop it!

100
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,349
I know you're scared...

101
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,637
...and you're angry and frustrated.
And I know none of this is fair.

102
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,430
But you cannot take it out on me.

103
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,949
Hey, I'm home.

104
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,275
Oh, we are dead.

105
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,835
Dead, man.

106
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,508
<i>Ruto</i> or <i>rute</i>
or however the hell you--

107
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,472
-This is conjecture.
-This is conjecture?

108
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,511
-Conjecture isn't helping.
-Conjecture--?

109
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,917
-We need to state the facts.
-Okay, fine. Facts, then. Fact A:

110
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,112
My phone rang eight times last night.
Dead air, hang ups every time.

111
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,992
Second fact:
Like 3 in the morning...

112
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,430
...I saw that Caddy of his
cruising my neighbourhood.

113
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,995
If he wanted to kill us,
he would've at the junkyard.

114
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,634
What is that, conjecture?

115
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,310
Are you basing that on that he's got
a normal, healthy brain or something?

116
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:16,752
Did you not see him beat a dude
to death for, like, nothing?

117
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,679
And that way--
That way he just kept staring at us...

118
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,316
...saying, "You're done."

119
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,475
"You're done"?

120
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,194
You know what that means?
I will tell you what that means.

121
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,153
That means
exactly how it sounds, yo.

122
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,828
All right. We are witnesses.
We are loose ends.

123
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,156
Right now, Tuco's thinking,
"Yeah, hey...

124
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,638
...they cook good meth,
but can I trust them?"

125
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,872
What happens
when he decides "no"?

126
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,509
No.

127
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,359
It is him or us. You understand?
It is him or us!

128
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,995
-How would you do it?
-What do you mean, how?

129
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,556
Specifically, how would you do it?
Step by step.

130
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,597
All right.

131
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,473
Say we set up one last sale.

132
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,752
This is providing he doesn't decide
to waste us before then.

133
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,032
Every time we bring in a new batch,
he always tests the product, right?

134
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,392
So as his head is down,
you know, giving it a snort, just:

135
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,309
So three shots?

136
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,077
-Three shots or, I don't know, two.
-Wait, is it two, or is it three?

137
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,555
-Two would probably work, I guess.
-Okay, two shots.

138
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,159
Two in the chest, in the face?

139
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,670
I'm just trying to understand
how this works.

140
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,316
Okay.
All right, we'll put a pin in that.

141
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,476
But by now, the big guy, Gonzo...

142
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,636
-...he's probably coming at you, right?
-Yeah.

143
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,910
-You turn toward him.
-Yeah, just wheel on him--

144
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,872
How many shots for him?
He's a big guy.

145
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,399
How many shots does that take?

146
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,318
-I don't know. Three shots.
-Three shots.

147
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,193
Okay, Tuco and Gonzo.
Two men down.

148
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,913
Now, is there anyone else there?

149
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,112
I mean, Tuco is usually
with someone else, right?

150
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,757
Maybe even a couple of guys.
His dealers, his posse.

151
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,192
All right.

152
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,550
So we'll put a pin in that one too.

153
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,637
At this point, how many shots fired?

154
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,718
You've gotta be running low.
How many bullets does that gun take?

155
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,397
It's not--

156
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,433
How can you suggest
that we kill a man...

157
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,154
...and you can't even open the gun?

158
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,357
-It's not that easy, is it?
-Hey, man, Walt, you did it.

159
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,031
Yeah.

160
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,311
Call Skyler.

161
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,678
<i>Hey, there. You've reached Walt,</i>
<i>Skyler and Walter, Jr.</i>

162
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,236
<i>We can't come to the phone right now,</i>
<i>so please leave us a message.</i>

163
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,715
Well, aren't you early bird,
up and out already?

164
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,388
The big lug and I are gonna go try
that new restaurant...

165
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,999
...over by UNM tonight...

166
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,589
...so let me know
if you guys wanna hang.

167
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,791
Listen to me. "Hang."

168
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,151
Walt Jr. will be proud.
I know the lingo.

169
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,873
I'm still hip.

170
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,028
It's Chinese. The restaurant.

171
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,993
I don't know,
I just feel like Chinese.

172
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,149
Do you think that people in China
ever just feel like American?

173
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,150
You know, and they go out
and get little takeout boxes...

174
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,920
...with mashed potatoes
and meat loaf...

175
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,636
...and try and figure out how
to use the little knives and forks?

176
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,229
I wonder if that ever happens.

177
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,830
All right, I'll let you go. So call me.

178
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,196
Skyler didn't pick up?

179
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,468
Obviously she's not home.

180
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,155
Baby. Baby, wait up.

181
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,555
Hey, what was that about Chinese?

182
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,637
Dinner tonight. That new place.

183
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,469
-How late they serve?
-I don't know.

184
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,477
You got Dave at 8.

185
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,520
-Not tonight.
-Yeah, you do. Remember?

186
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,233
No, that's Thursday.

187
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,716
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's Thursday.

188
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,115
Remember how at the last minute
they changed it?

189
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,834
They were gonna charge us
a penalty.

190
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,031
Look, baby,
you only got six more sessions.

191
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,309
And I'm doing them, Hank.

192
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,318
I said I would do them,
and I'm doing them.

193
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,592
I can't help it if you got
your days of the week wrong.

194
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,870
Look out. Sorry, Mr. Schrader.

195
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,997
Look, it's.... You know, it's just....

196
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,792
Oh, boy. I....

197
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,028
I think Dave is really helping you.

198
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,478
Yeah.

199
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,309
Yeah.

200
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,989
Sorry about that.

201
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,431
She's....

202
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,036
Hey! Hey, where's my phone call?

203
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,558
Hits two in the sand,
two in the forest...

204
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,194
-...and then he says, "Give me a four."
-Hey, Gomez.

205
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,834
Gomez? What do you got for me?

206
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,951
Come on. Chop-chop.

207
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,469
Good morning to you too.

208
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,031
A.P.D. sent this over.
This was about eight or 10 days ago.

209
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,073
-You know Southwest Aniline, right?
-Yeah, off the 25?

210
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,429
The place smells like feet.

211
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,790
This is them. Check this out.

212
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:46,391
-Holy shit. What was that?
-Thermite. So they tell me.

213
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,272
Burns about 5000 degrees.

214
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,391
Kind of stuff you see
on a James Bond movie.

215
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,115
Nice. Guys who know their trade.

216
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,157
Wait. I take that back.

217
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,989
What, they didn't think
about stealing a hand truck?

218
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,795
Hey, try rolling it, morons.
It's a barrel.

219
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,718
It rolls. Jesus.

220
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,668
-So, what'd they get?
-Methylamine, 30 gallons.

221
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,911
P2P?

222
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,873
They're cooking
old school biker meth.

223
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,668
Who the hell still does that?

224
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,553
All the old-timers I know
are either dead or in prison.

225
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,192
Pseudo's in short supply...

226
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,790
...so these two make do
by changing up the formula.

227
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,468
That and the thermite...

228
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,750
...I'd say these two
know their chemistry.

229
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,520
-But ranking them as burglars?
-Shit.

230
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,439
I wouldn't trust these two
to break into the Special Olympics.

231
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,757
They got book learning
but no street skills.

232
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,279
Maybe they're college kids.

233
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,232
Chem students
trying to make a big score.

234
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,556
Yeah, maybe.

235
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,228
I tell you, 30 gallons of precursor....

236
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,398
That big a score, they're gonna
wind up stepping on some toes.

237
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,912
Tell you what, they better pray
it's us who catches up to them...

238
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,759
...and not those boys from Juarez.

239
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,513
Your daughter wants out.

240
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,918
<i>Hey there. You've reached Walt,</i>
<i>Skyler and Walter Jr.</i>

241
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,634
<i>We can't come to the phone,</i>
<i>so please leave us a message.</i>

242
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,995
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

243
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,633
<i>Thought I'd try you earlier...</i>

244
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,310
<i>...before you go out</i>
<i>and, you know, face the day.</i>

245
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,714
<i>I'm realising now...</i>

246
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,798
<i>...it probably takes you a little longer</i>
<i>to get to the phone...</i>

247
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,151
<i>...owing to the extra baby weight--</i>

248
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,633
Hey, sweetie.

249
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,794
Walt, did you spend
the entire night out here?

250
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,438
No.

251
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,711
No, no. Well, not all of it.

252
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,396
Oh, yeah. I did have a touch of--
My stomach, you know.

253
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,434
I knew I was gonna be up and down,
so I just didn't wanna wake you.

254
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,679
-How would he know where I live?
-You sure it was Tuco?

255
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,915
Who else could it be?

256
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,076
-Did you ever tell him my name?
-No.

257
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,157
Did you tell him
where I live or anything?

258
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,157
-No.
-What about Gonzo, or the dead one?

259
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,430
-Did you tell them anything?
-I didn't say jack.

260
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,030
Okay, Tuco must've put out,
like, you know, feelers.

261
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,199
He's got his ways and means, yo.
Sources, all right? He's closing in.

262
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,350
And what happens when he finds out
that my brother-in-law is a DEA agent?

263
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,437
Oh, God. What happens then?

264
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,436
Look, it's got five bullets.

265
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,872
I finally figured out how to....
Look, I just finally-- I figured it out.

266
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,548
I say we get a second gun, right?
For you.

267
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,514
I mean, don't we, like,
double our chances?

268
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,392
I mean, mathematically.

269
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,629
I've got a better idea.

270
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,596
Thank God.

271
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,119
All right.

272
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,550
What is it, Mr. White?
Lay it on me.

273
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,678
-Beans.
-Beans?

274
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,073
They're castor beans.

275
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,838
So, what are we gonna do
with them?

276
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,389
Are we just gonna grow
a magic beanstalk?

277
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,113
Climb it and escape?

278
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,629
We are going to process them
into ricin.

279
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,359
Rice and beans?

280
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,313
Ricin.
It's an extremely effective poison.

281
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,711
It's toxic in small doses.

282
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,275
Also fairly easy to overlook
during an autopsy.

283
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,156
All right.

284
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,033
-All right. So--
-Don't touch them.

285
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,192
-You can get poisoned from beans?
-Yes.

286
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,712
Back in the late '70s, ricin was used
to assassinate a Bulgarian journalist.

287
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,396
The KGB modified
the tip of an umbrella...

288
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,591
...to inject a tiny pellet
into the man's leg.

289
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,076
And we're talking about an amount
not bigger than the head of a pin.

290
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,509
But it-- It killed him?

291
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,551
Oh, yes.

292
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,040
Now we just need to figure out
a delivery device...

293
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,995
...and then no more Tuco.

294
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,831
-Hey, Sky.
-Hey, Hank.

295
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,992
How you doing?

296
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,033
Is this.... This a bad time?

297
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,550
No, come on in.

298
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,875
I should've called first. I'm sorry.

299
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,631
What can I do for you?

300
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,511
Maybe we ought--

301
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,597
You wanna sit down first?

302
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,275
I don't know, Hank.

303
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:44,517
Depends on whether or not
this is gonna be about Marie.

304
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,429
-Did she send you?
-Hell, no.

305
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,108
She's barely even talking to me.

306
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,072
That's why I'm here, okay?

307
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,193
Self-preservation. Big time.

308
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,918
Look...

309
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,596
...I know you gals have
your ups and downs.

310
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,199
-I get it.
-Gals.

311
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:12,551
And I need to get involved
like I need a second hole in my ass.

312
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,555
But if you could do me this huge favour
and just return her phone calls.

313
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,318
I don't think
I'm quite ready to do that yet.

314
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,229
Communication. Communication,
right? Back and forth. Come on.

315
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,716
Sky, do this for me, please.
You can yell at her.

316
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,115
Just call her back.

317
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,756
Marie is a shoplifter, Hank.

318
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,919
That's right.

319
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,877
That baby tiara
she gave me at the shower?

320
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,197
She stole it
from Gertrude Zachary's. Yeah.

321
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,597
I almost got arrested
when I went back to return it.

322
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:58,078
And Marie won't admit it.
She won't apologise.

323
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,069
Yeah.

324
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,479
If I thought you were gonna return it,
I would have never, you know....

325
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,515
You knew about this.

326
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,909
We're working on it.

327
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,078
I mean,
she's got this therapist, Dave.

328
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,078
-And I mean, Dave is really good.
-Dave's good, yeah.

329
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,794
But it's an ongoing process, Sky...

330
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,515
...and we have gotta be
understanding, you know?

331
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,119
I mean, we gotta, you know.

332
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,835
We gotta support the shit out of her.

333
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,709
Do we?

334
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,239
Yeah.

335
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,273
I need support.

336
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,153
Me.

337
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,271
The almost-40-year-old
pregnant woman...

338
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,198
...with the surprise baby on the way.

339
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,478
And the husband
with the lung cancer...

340
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,319
...who disappears for hours,
and I don't know where he goes.

341
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,397
And he barely
even speaks to me anymore.

342
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,474
With the moody son
who does the same thing.

343
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,352
And the overdrawn
checking account.

344
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,950
And the lukewarm water heater
that leaks rusty-looking crap...

345
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,754
...and is rotting out the floor
of the utility closet...

346
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,996
...and we can't even afford to fix it.

347
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,033
But, oh, I see.

348
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,754
Now I'm supposed to go,
"Hank, please...

349
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,349
...what can I possibly do
to further benefit...

350
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,199
...my spoiled, kleptomaniac,
bitch sister...

351
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:24,198
...who somehow always manages
to be the centre of attention?"

352
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,111
Because God knows she's the one
with the really important problems.

353
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,918
Want me to take a look
at that utility closet?

354
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,592
That's all it takes?

355
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,195
That's all it takes.

356
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,753
So now what?

357
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,960
Now we arrange our next meet.

358
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,390
In a public place this time.
Nice and safe.

359
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,556
Business as usual.

360
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,275
And after we sell him our usual
four pounds, then we'll pull this out.

361
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,509
"By the way, Tuco, this is a new
formula we've been working on.

362
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,789
Care to try it?"

363
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,672
Okay, well, what's new about it?

364
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,910
I mean, just in case he asks.
What do we say?

365
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,599
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

366
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,153
It gets the user insanely high.

367
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,669
I mean, how much salesmanship
do we really need?

368
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,190
That degenerate snorts anything
he gets his hands on.

369
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,437
Okay, well, we'll just put
a pin in that, then.

370
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,559
Anyway, within the next 48 hours,
maybe 72...

371
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,228
...it'll look like natural causes.

372
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,319
-What, like a heart attack?
-Yeah.

373
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,351
Or the flu, maybe.

374
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,279
His associates won't know
any differently...

375
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,230
...and we'll be in the clear.

376
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,273
Not if Tuco kills us first.

377
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,876
Just keep it down.

378
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:52,116
Hey, Hank. What's up?

379
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,833
<i>Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

380
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,629
You been home yet?

381
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:01,350
No. Why?

382
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,834
<i>Well....</i>

383
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,279
Because I really screwed up.

384
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,438
<i>I apologise in advance for the earful</i>
<i>you're gonna hear from Skyler.</i>

385
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,279
<i>I was trying to get her and Marie</i>
<i>talking again. Big mistake.</i>

386
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,508
-I should have just kept out of it.
<i>-Yeah, well, okay.</i>

387
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,233
Me and my big mouth, I guess.

388
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,955
Yeah, well, that-- You know, it happens.
It's no problem. No worries.

389
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,628
<i>Yeah, well, thanks, man.</i>
<i>I appreciate that.</i>

390
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,629
Jesus, the wives, huh?

391
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,115
Hank, unfortunately, I really--

392
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,676
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Hey, man, don't let me keep you.</i>

393
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,510
Actually, I'm at work, so.... Oh, hey.

394
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,358
You wanna see something
really freaky?

395
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,711
-Well, I would, but--
<i>-Seriously, Walt, this is....</i>

396
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,839
You gotta check out this crime scene
me and Gomie are at. Just a second.

397
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,955
<i>Hank.</i>

398
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,196
Hang on. It should be
coming through right now.

399
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,428
Guess it could be worse, huh?
Could be having a day like these two.

400
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,951
<i>Couple of local bulletheads.</i>

401
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,993
Guess they pissed off
the wrong guy.

402
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,397
<i>Walt, you there?</i>

403
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,073
<i>Hey, Walt?</i>

404
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,600
-I'm taking this.
-No. It's my gun. I need it!

405
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,268
No, you don't. Not if you leave town.
Get out of here.

406
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,472
Tuco killing Gonzo means
he's coming after us next. I've....

407
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,911
I've gotta get home. My family.

408
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,311
Skyler?

409
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,030
Walter, Jr.?

410
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,031
Skyler?

411
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,998
Hey.

412
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,038
Where's Walter, Jr.?

413
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,755
Having dinner at Louis' house.
Supposedly.

414
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,118
Yep. All day, I've had
the whole house to myself.

415
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,113
So where have you been
this time?

416
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,116
Walt?

417
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,637
Walt?

418
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,233
Walt, will you come in here
and talk to me please?

419
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,077
Walt!

420
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,555
I'll be right there.

421
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,390
Yeah, I recognise
these two knobjobs.

422
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,909
Known associates
of a psychotic piece of shit...

423
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,314
...named Tuco Salamanca.

424
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,954
-Guess he got tired of associating.
-Yeah.

425
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,674
-Hey, do you mind if I get in there?
-No, go ahead.

426
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,030
Thanks.

427
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,469
The big one smells fresher.

428
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,554
You guys find a death wound?

429
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,071
I see lots of blood,
but no bullet holes.

430
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,873
Yeah. You done taking pictures?

431
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,553
All right. Let's lay them out flat.

432
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,795
Let me get out of your way here,
man.

433
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,999
Snap.

434
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,919
Damn, Ricky.
Leave something for the coroner.

435
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,476
Oh, this is beautiful.

436
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,351
Hey, someone call Jay Leno.

437
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,198
We got the world's
dumbest criminal.

438
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,709
This guy wasn't murdered. Look.

439
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,708
Big stuff here
was moving this guy's body...

440
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,117
...when the stack must have shifted.

441
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,552
Crushed his arm, pinned him here,
and he bled out.

442
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,151
-Poetic justice. Oh, I love it.
-Don't you just?

443
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,396
Get a photo of me
with this guy, all right?

444
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,717
Old stumpy, here.
Make sure you get the stump in there.

445
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,352
Walt, would you talk to me, please?

446
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,234
I don't know where to begin.

447
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,193
What the hell are you doing here?

448
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,069
Get in.

449
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:55,593
Get in.

450
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,837
Let's go.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

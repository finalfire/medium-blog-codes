1
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:48,110
Hey, Captain America.

2
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,235
-What's up, brother?
-Hey, bro.

3
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,751
This is stupid.

4
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,632
-You got a better idea?
-Okay, fun. Whatever.

5
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,832
-So when do we, you know?
-We don't, for now.

6
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,156
No cooking until things settle down.

7
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,069
Settle down? I thought you're the one
that said nothing's changed.

8
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,316
Look, I just put my family
through an ordeal...

9
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,798
...that they're just now
starting to accept, okay? I can't--

10
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,475
That's too expensive.

11
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,029
Look, I can't leave my house...

12
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,515
...for more than 20 minutes
without my wife worrying.

13
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,472
I need time to mend fences.

14
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,355
Okay, so while you're fixing fences,
what about me, huh?

15
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,030
Your A-hole brother-in-law
took all my money.

16
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,439
That's $600.

17
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,959
Okay, what about the rest?

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,433
-Rest of what?
-Half your money's mine.

19
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,756
Fifty-fifty partners.
That's our business motto.

20
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,997
Meaning what, exactly?
That I suffer for your carelessness?

21
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,077
You're the one who wanted
to work with Tuco.

22
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,033
Okay. If it weren't for that,
none of this would've happened.

23
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,272
Just be cool.
We'll talk about this later, okay?

24
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,036
As for now, no contact. Understood?

25
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,475
Where are you going?

26
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,359
I leave first.

27
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,755
-Walt!
-In the kitchen.

28
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,754
Hey.

29
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,916
Hey. I didn't know
you were allowed to touch the stove.

30
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,271
Hilarious, Groucho.
Go on, grab a seat.

31
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,959
Juice is on the table.

32
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,275
What?

33
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,079
-Good morning, honey.
-Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,714
Dad's cooking breakfast.

35
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,639
But don't worry.
I'm also doing all the dishes.

36
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,916
Nice? Follow me.

37
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,998
There's also orange juice
and grapefruit juice...

38
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,033
...which, personally, as you know,
I've never been a fan of.

39
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,199
But considering all the polyphenols
and the limonoids, can't hurt.

40
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,029
Walt, you didn't have to do this.

41
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,433
I wanted to.

42
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,398
-Grapefruit juice?
-Yes, please. Thanks.

43
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,995
There you go. Honey?

44
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,430
No, I'll stick with orange, thank you.

45
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,911
All right. Dig in, dig in.
Pancakes are not getting hotter.

46
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,593
-Yeah.
-There you go.

47
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,189
All right. Got one. Steely Dan.

48
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,233
-No.
-Yes, absolutely.

49
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,908
No, in terms of pure musicianship...

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,839
...I would put them up against
any current band you can name.

51
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,474
You wouldn't know
any current bands.

52
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,669
-That's besides the point.
-Have a good day, honey.

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,359
You too.

54
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,672
-Boz Scaggs. There's another one.
-Boz Scaggs.

55
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,236
Whoever they are.
Bye. Thanks for breakfast.

56
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,395
-Bye.
-You're welcome.

57
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,113
Tell Louis to drive carefully.

58
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,673
All right.

59
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,710
Our son doesn't know
who Boz Scaggs is.

60
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,070
We have failed as parents.

61
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,715
Come to think of it...

62
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,434
-...I barely know who Boz Scaggs is.
-Stop it.

63
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,677
Give me your plate.
No, no. I'll get it. I'll get it. Yeah.

64
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,233
Thank you.

65
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,712
Hey, listen...

66
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,036
...in the calendar section...

67
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,591
...all week long...

68
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,955
...there's a fiction writer's seminar
at UNM.

69
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,391
And, you know, probably talking
about how to get published...

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,989
-...and that sort of thing.
-Yeah?

71
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,789
Yeah, so, anyway,
I thought maybe you might....

72
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,711
I mean, I'll go with you if you like.

73
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,711
Oh, and...

74
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,676
...you know, I was thinking about
what you asked me the other night.

75
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,110
You were wondering
if I had a second cell phone.

76
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,709
And, well, I've been
thinking about that a lot...

77
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,835
...and I think what you heard
was my cell phone alarm going off.

78
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,232
I've been using it a lot
as a medication reminder...

79
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,439
...to, well, remind me
to take my medication.

80
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,434
And, well, the weird thing is that...

81
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,269
...the alarm sound
is almost exactly the same...

82
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,472
...as the regular phone ring
which is really a poor design...

83
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,150
...if you ask me.
But I think that was probably it.

84
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,352
I tried to go in
and change it to a different sound...

85
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,755
...other than the phone ring, but....

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,998
They so overcomplicate
these things.

87
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,396
Anyway, it was probably
just as well that I lost it.

88
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,629
There's gotta be a new one
on the market by now.

89
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,515
You know, if we do this thing
at UNM, maybe on the way home...

90
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,632
...we can stop by,
and I can get a new cell phone.

91
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,479
Skyler?

92
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,235
Skyler?

93
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,078
-Ready?
-Yo, for what, might help.

94
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,320
Not another intervention.

95
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,151
Jesse Bruce Pinkman...

96
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,079
...pursuant to Section 47-8-13...

97
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,157
...of the New Mexico
Real Property Code...

98
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,191
...you are hereby
given notice to vacate...

99
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:41,757
...the premises listed as 9809 Margo,
Albuquerque, 87104.

100
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,077
Wait. What? You're kicking me
out of my own house?

101
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,589
-It's your aunt Ginny's house.
-And she gave it to me.

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,233
She never gave it to you, Jesse.

103
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,079
You were allowed
residentiary privileges.

104
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,397
Your parents have always
been the property owners.

105
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,149
Look, we talked about this, okay?
I'd sell the house, we'd split it fifty-fifty.

106
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,669
That was the deal.
What the hell happened?

107
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,440
What happened is
you're a speed manufacturer.

108
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,835
No, I'm not. What?

109
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,476
A DEA agent came
looking for you, Jesse.

110
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,875
He came to our front door.

111
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,629
Okay, because I've actually
been helping them...

112
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,469
...which I could get into
a lot of trouble for telling you...

113
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,557
...so you're welcome.

114
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,830
I saw your basement.

115
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,869
Oh, yeah.

116
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,789
I was worried, so I went
over there and I let myself in...

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,198
...and I found your laboratory.

118
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,990
You guys have your own key?

119
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,550
Manufacture of a Schedule ll
controlled substance...

120
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,390
...is a second degree felony.

121
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,713
Under federal asset seizure...

122
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,957
...the government can take
the entire house.

123
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,676
It's not even there anymore.
I cleaned it all out.

124
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,269
Son, we can't stop you
from ruining your life...

125
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,756
...but you will not drag us down
with you.

126
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,799
Vacate the house in 72 hours.

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,911
Otherwise,
your parents have authorised me...

128
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,396
...to contact the authorities.
Is that clear?

129
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,035
Do you have any questions for us?

130
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,918
Three days, Mr. Pinkman.

131
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,154
Come on.

132
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,679
-Hi.
-Hey.

133
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,789
-I fixed the garage door.
-Great.

134
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,353
Yeah.

135
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:28,120
One track was bent.
That's why it was bouncing.

136
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,799
Okay.

137
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,519
-Where were you today?
-Out.

138
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,631
Is everything okay?

139
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,478
Yeah, everything's fine.

140
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,833
Hey, for what it's worth, I was thinking
about going back to those meetings...

141
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,837
...the cancer support group.

142
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,792
I think that that's good.

143
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,554
Yeah.

144
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,550
Yeah, that's good.

145
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,594
You were right
on the money about that.

146
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,991
It's good to, you know...

147
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,836
...talk about things.

148
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,357
I think that's great.

149
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,838
Yeah.

150
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,033
Jesse.

151
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,909
Jesse. Hey, Jesse.

152
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,509
You don't answer your phone?

153
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,951
Yeah, no, I've just been...

154
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,674
...pretty busy. How'd you--?

155
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,475
Oh, right, you have that key.

156
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,916
Hey, listen.

157
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,194
So I've been thinking
a lot about our conversation...

158
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,632
...we had the other day,
and I completely get why...

159
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,037
...Dad totally tweaked off on me
like that and....

160
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,789
-It's not just your father, Jesse.
-No, I know. I know. I know.

161
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,994
I'm just saying it was a really,
really big wake-up call for me...

162
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,033
...which is why I wanted to talk
to you. You know, I've been...

163
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,516
...thinking real seriously
about business school, actually.

164
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,075
You can do the whole thing
from your computer now....

165
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,636
No, Mom, Mom.
Hey, hey, this is good.

166
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,435
You know, we're talking,
starting a dialogue.

167
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,837
The time for talking
has passed, Jesse.

168
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,111
Hey. Hey.

169
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,639
What the hell, yo?

170
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,877
-I thought it was just a wake-up call.
-We are putting it in storage.

171
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,196
When you decide to grow up,
you can have it back.

172
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,595
Why don't you grow up, Mom?

173
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,792
Ginny wanted me here.
I was the one who took care of her.

174
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,151
I took her to her appointments
and made her lunch every day.

175
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,554
I earned this.

176
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,990
You did not make
her lunch every day.

177
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,872
What did you do, huh?

178
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,640
She's lying there dying,
and where the hell are you?

179
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,035
-Don't start with me.
-Now what?

180
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,391
You've decided to, I don't know,
make your eldest son homeless?

181
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,710
Great family, Mom.

182
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,676
Why are you like this? Why?

183
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,588
You have two sets of keys
and the padlock to the garage.

184
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,508
Leave them on the kitchen counter
when you leave.

185
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,039
No, Mom, Mom, Mom.

186
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,198
Hey, where am I supposed to go?

187
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,556
I don't know, sweetheart.

188
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,788
But please turn your life around.

189
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,912
Yeah, this is gonna help
bigtime with that. Bitch!

190
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,871
Jeez.

191
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,869
Oh, hey, Mr. White.

192
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,719
Hey, well, that's the way.
Don't just sit out there honking.

193
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,194
Come in and say hello.

194
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,153
Hey, we've got omelettes.
You want an omelette?

195
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,355
No, I'm good.

196
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,393
New Mexican Christmas style,
red and green chillies.

197
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,397
No. Thank you, though.

198
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,239
Flynn and me gotta get going.

199
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,077
-Who's Flynn?
-Flynn.

200
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,157
He's your....

201
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,951
-Flynn?
-Yeah.

202
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,673
So?

203
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,637
So? Nothing.

204
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,350
-You ready?
-Like it.

205
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,198
-Bye, Mr. White.
-Okay.

206
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,439
Bye.

207
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,348
Flynn? You know about this
Flynn thing?

208
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,069
Okay. Flynn. Yeah.
As in what, Errol?

209
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,397
I don't know. It's what he likes
to be called these days.

210
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,397
What's wrong with Walter Jr.?

211
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,511
Don't take it personally.

212
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,556
He wants his own identity.

213
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,312
You think he told Louis about me?

214
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,830
-About the blackout?
-Louis is his friend, Walt...

215
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,508
...and your disappearance
upset him.

216
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,710
Hey, I made omelettes.

217
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,354
I'm going out, but thanks, though.

218
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,039
Where you going?

219
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,476
Can you get the phone, please?

220
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,156
Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

221
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,989
-White residence.
-<i>Yo, it's me. Is this a good time?</i>

222
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,190
What part of "no contact"
didn't you understand?

223
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,392
-I know, but there's a problem.
-<i>I don't care. We agreed.</i>

224
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,558
No amount of pay-per-view channels
is gonna make any difference.

225
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,955
Honey, we're happy
with our cable provider, right?

226
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,874
Yeah, we're happy.

227
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,791
Skyler? Sky?

228
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,875
Where are you going?
Can you at least tell me that?

229
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,433
Out.

230
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,315
Should probably get that, Walt.
I'll be back in a few hours.

231
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,432
Skyler.

232
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,598
-What?
-Yo, I get I shouldn't call...

233
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,155
...but I'm in a situation here,
and I need my money.

234
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,998
I just gave you $600.

235
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,428
And thanks, Daddy Warbucks...

236
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,631
...but that was
before my housing situation...

237
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,876
...went completely
testicular on me, okay?

238
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,991
<i>You smoked the entire 600,</i>
<i>didn't you?</i>

239
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,428
-What? No.
-<i>Yes.</i>

240
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,675
-No.
-<i>Look, Jesse...</i>

241
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,359
<i>...your problems are just that.:</i>

242
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,152
Your problems.

243
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,954
No contact. Do not call here ever.

244
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,869
-When the moment is right, I will call.
-<i>Mr. White, you're not listening.</i>

245
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,196
They're kicking me out of my house.

246
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,832
You son of a bitch.

247
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,276
Son of a bitch.

248
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,070
Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.

249
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,113
Thanks, man. Hey, guy!
You forgot something! Yeah!

250
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,790
You forgot your ice trays!
You're gonna need the ice trays!

251
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,231
Hey, you forgot something here!
Take this!

252
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,394
Hold on, buddy.

253
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,672
Yo, we should get Twaughthammer
up and running again, yo. I'm serious.

254
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,916
I know. That sounded tight.

255
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,872
Hey, thanks again, P.

256
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,914
I made sure this stucknut exterminator,
you know, put me on his speed dial.

257
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,189
Two nights tops.

258
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,709
No, you still staying
at your aunt's on Margo?

259
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,309
Yeah. I'm thinking of moving.
Nob Hill, probably.

260
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,718
Jess-a-matic. Living the dream.

261
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,915
Yeah.

262
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,157
Okay, buddy. You're gonna eat your
carrots like we talked about, right?

263
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,315
Too hot.

264
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,432
No, no, buddy. Remember. Okay?
Come on, yes.

265
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,993
Listen, hey, talk to me, man.

266
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,589
Are you still having
mad relations out there?

267
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,836
You can talk to me.
I won't hate a player.

268
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:33,636
I can't lie. It's pretty hectic
out there, female-wise.

269
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,915
Damn. I'm hating, man.

270
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,918
That's why we need to get the Hammer
up and running, you know?

271
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,556
-Get you out of the house.
-How awesome would that be?

272
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,352
Come on. Look. What?

273
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,917
I cut all the green parts off like you--
Just eat them. Please?

274
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,556
We should do this. Track down
Cheevo and Anthony and demo up.

275
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,829
Get back in the scene.

276
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,755
I'm sorry, man.
Just hold on one second, all right?

277
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,918
Okay, listen. How about
you take a bite of your sandwich...

278
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,712
...and then you take--

279
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,396
Mommy's home.

280
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,355
-Hi.
-Hello.

281
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,869
Hey, honey, you remember
Jesse Pinkman?

282
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,718
His house is getting bug bombed.
I said he could crash a few nights.

283
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,751
-Hey, Jesse.
-Hey.

284
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,349
Paul, could you help me
in the bedroom with these?

285
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,760
Sure. Yeah.

286
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,397
Yeah, I used to not like carrots, too.

287
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,116
Hey, Hen, I think
it's someone's nap time. Come on.

288
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,357
Man, dude, you're gonna kill me.

289
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:09,997
I totally spaced that the in-laws
are crashing this weekend.

290
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,553
You got other people to call?

291
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,035
No, that's cool.
I got tons of people. Yeah.

292
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,276
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

293
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,797
Yo, in-laws?

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,629
-Sucks to be you, P.
-Yeah. Yeah, I know, huh?

295
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,238
Here.

296
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,793
See you, man.

297
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,911
It's good to see you.

298
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,991
Look, I'm asking to crash three,
maybe four nights, and--

299
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,033
Look, I already called Badger,
all right? I called everyone.

300
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,595
I need a solid here, bro.

301
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,153
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

302
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,110
All right. All right.
Hey, how about this?

303
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,909
What if it's just for tonight?

304
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,833
Wait. No, you cannot be serious.

305
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,998
-You cannot be serious.
-Hey.

306
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,229
Someone took your bike, man.

307
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,351
Not cool.

308
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,271
-Morning.
-Oh, hey.

309
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,799
Morning.

310
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,993
Where did--? Where did Mom go?

311
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,358
Out.

312
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,470
Where's breakfast?

313
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,548
Hey.

314
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,472
Let's go do something.

315
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,232
Like what?

316
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,151
Something fun.

317
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,758
All right, ready? Let's put it in gear.

318
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,839
-Is your foot on the-- Okay. Good.
-Yeah. I got it.

319
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,035
Good.

320
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,710
Yes. Nice and smooth. Good.
Just like that.

321
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,352
Good. I like the hands at 10 and 2.
Very nice.

322
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,755
Okay, let's slow down here...

323
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,952
...to a stop in preparation
for a left-hand turn. Okay.

324
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,958
All right. You might wanna
go easier on the brake.

325
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,754
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right. You're doing fine.

326
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,714
-Much better than last time, huh?
-Oh, yeah, Louis has been helping me.

327
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,119
Has he?

328
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,550
Good. Good. Okay.

329
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,716
Don't forget the turn indic-- Good.

330
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,229
I'll stop talking.
You know what you're doing.

331
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,159
And let's make that left-hand turn.

332
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,914
Nice and smooth. Very nice.

333
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,639
Right hand.

334
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,555
Good. Good. Okay.

335
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,755
-Are you using both feet?
-Yeah.

336
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,030
No. Wait. Wait. No, Walt.
You can't do that.

337
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,276
You can't use one foot
on each pedal.

338
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,074
-Why not?
-Because you can't. Stop, Walt. Okay.

339
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,831
-Just stop, please. Right. All right.
-Dad, this is way easier.

340
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,119
There's the easy way,
and then there's the right way, right?

341
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,278
So let's just try it again,
right foot only.

342
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,118
-All right.
-Okay?

343
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,796
Okay, just-- You don't have to--
Okay. All right. That's fine.

344
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,753
Just-- That's okay. That's okay.
Just try it again.

345
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,589
Here we go.
Let's just, just try it again.

346
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,953
Okay.

347
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,391
Don't-- Just easy.
Okay, okay, good. Great.

348
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,989
That was better. See?
Right? Better? Right.

349
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,838
The gas, the brake,
the gas, the brake.

350
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,439
I can't do this.

351
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,718
My legs don't work that way.

352
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,639
Your legs are fine.
You just have to stick with it.

353
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,638
Don't set limits for yourself, Walt.
You're all right.

354
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,116
All right. We'll get this. I promise.
Now let's just try again. All right?

355
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,390
-All right.
-Here we go. Here we go.

356
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,273
Okay, well, you don't need to,
you know, just take off.

357
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,119
But all right, here we go.
Slow it down just a little bit.

358
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,791
All right, we have a turn coming up
here, so prepare to apply the brakes.

359
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,230
Prepare, Walt, for the brakes.
Brakes, the brakes.

360
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,158
-Braking.
-You're using both feet again.

361
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,555
-It's not stopping.
-That's the gas. Use the brake.

362
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,478
The break. Brake, brake, brake!

363
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,719
Okay.

364
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,038
That's one way to stop.

365
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,672
I told you.

366
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,279
Flynn.

367
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,398
-Hands up, asshole!
-Yo, yo, it's cool.

368
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,158
So help me, I will spread you.

369
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,318
No, please, no, all right?
It's me, okay? It's Jesse.

370
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,236
All right? Look, this is my RV.

371
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,954
You towed it.
Your cousin Badger, remember?

372
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,991
What the hell you doing here?

373
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,029
-You smell like shit.
-It's a long story.

374
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,629
So I fixed up your felonious
rolling laboratory here...

375
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,989
...750 for the repair.

376
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,272
Make it a grand, counting the toilet
plus the 500 you already owe me...

377
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,031
...and you're good to drive on out of
here to someplace far away. Upwind.

378
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,593
Okay.

379
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,793
Here's the thing.

380
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,319
I can't pay you today.

381
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,795
But I can pay you this week,
all right?

382
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,757
Seventeen fifty? We'll make it 1750,
for, like, you know, interest.

383
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,758
-I thought your word was your bond.
-It totally is.

384
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,430
Definitely. I just don't have
the money at this particular moment.

385
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,831
But I will, soon.

386
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,157
Here's my counteroffer.

387
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,352
I kick you out.
I take payment from your inventory.

388
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,074
I know a guy that'll pay
premium for this kind of crap.

389
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,636
All right. Two grand. Okay?

390
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,230
Two days, two grand.
That's totally fair.

391
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,718
Just don't take my cook stuff.
All right? That's all I got left.

392
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,150
Please, all right? I really....

393
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,912
God, I really need a break here.
Okay?

394
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,677
Clovis, come on.

395
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,917
I don't know.
There's a bunch of stuff in there.

396
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,714
There's something called
methylamine. Me-- Meth....

397
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,229
However the hell you pronounce it.
Methylamine.

398
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,557
I don't know. I banged on it.
It sounds pretty full to me.

399
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,230
Holy shit. How much?

400
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,234
Hey! Hey!

401
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,108
Skyler.

402
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,589
Louis took Walt to school.

403
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,511
I was thinking maybe...

404
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,076
...this would be a good time to talk.

405
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,914
I dreamt that I owned
an antique bicycle repair shop.

406
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,358
In Ireland.

407
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,874
Weird.

408
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,918
Sounds weird.

409
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,195
I wanted to apologise...

410
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,313
...for everything.

411
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,519
My...

412
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,908
...desire for privacy.

413
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,598
My emotional...

414
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,076
...unavailability.

415
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,598
Having cancer
doesn't excuse all that.

416
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,912
I haven't been
a good partner to you...

417
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,638
...and for that...

418
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,272
...I'm very sorry.

419
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,039
I love you.

420
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,631
And I love this family.

421
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,918
And I just...

422
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,198
...want to make sure that...

423
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,196
...we don't lose contact.

424
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,273
Thank you.

425
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,079
Okay.

426
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,559
I agree.

427
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,959
Is that it?

428
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,469
God.

429
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,750
God, how long are
you gonna do this?

430
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,390
-Do what?
-This.

431
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,318
Not talking to me.

432
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,872
Going out all day
and refusing to tell me where.

433
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,230
You are obviously angry with me
about something...

434
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,476
...so let's talk about it.

435
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,039
Oh, God.

436
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,075
I feel like you're upset with me
because you think...

437
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,431
...that I'm up to something.

438
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,357
-Like what?
-I have no idea, Skyler.

439
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,632
What, that I'm having an affair?
Is that it? Is that what you think?

440
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,796
Is that why you asked me
about the....

441
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,231
Some other phone? Because you think
that I'm being unfaithful?

442
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,111
-I don't know.
-Okay.

443
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,117
So ask me.

444
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,959
Why?

445
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,352
-Would you even tell me?
-Yes. I would.

446
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,312
Of course, I would.

447
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,548
And no. I'm not.
I'm not having an affair, okay?

448
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,320
Now, what do I do
to prove that to you?

449
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,830
Swear an oath? My right hand
to God. I'm not having an affair.

450
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,758
I heard you, Walt.

451
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,991
You're not having an affair.

452
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,754
Congratulations.

453
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,269
No, you know what?
Congratulations to you, Skyler.

454
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,515
Great job.

455
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,358
What is this? What do I have to do?

456
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,314
-I'm trying to talk to you, and you--
-Okay, so talk, Walt.

457
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,952
Shut up and say something
that isn't complete bullshit.

458
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,956
You want to know
what you have to do?

459
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,039
You have to tell me
what's really going on right now.

460
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,959
Today. No more excuses.

461
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,994
No more apologies.
No more of these-- These obvious...

462
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,668
...desperate breakfasts.

463
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,992
You don't wanna lose
contact with me, Walt?

464
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,679
Good.

465
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,677
Then tell me.

466
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,633
Now.

467
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,272
Tell you what?

468
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,518
Skyler.

469
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,391
What is it you want me to tell you?
I don't know.

470
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,388
We're not done here. Skyler.

471
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,916
Do you know what
I've done for this family?

472
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,839
What the--?

473
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,153
-Yo, I'm really sorry, okay?
-What is wrong with you?

474
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,749
Why are you blue? Jesus.

475
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,236
I'm sorry. Let's just say it starts
with my parents being greedy...

476
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:20,069
-...kleptomaniac douche bags.
-Are you actually this stupid?

477
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,998
No, look. I know this isn't a optimal--

478
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,159
To come to my house and park
on my street, driving this vehicle.

479
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:30,399
I mean, what the hell is wrong
with you? I'm really asking.

480
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,440
-Nothing. I'm sorry. I just--
-What if Skyler had seen you?

481
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,393
What then? What was the plan then,
genius, huh?

482
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,830
-I don't know.
-You know why you don't know?

483
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,110
Because you don't think. That's why.

484
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,914
You don't think.
You never figured out how to think.

485
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,635
I said I was sorry. I just need
my half of the money, and I will go.

486
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,153
Your half?

487
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,749
There is no your half of the money.

488
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,394
There is only my all of it.
Do you understand?

489
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,751
Why should I be penalised
because of your sloppiness?

490
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,837
Look, that is completely uncool,
all right?

491
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,758
We agreed, fifty-fifty partners.

492
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,872
Partners in what?
What exactly do you do here?

493
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,152
I've been meaning to ask,
because I'm the producer, right?

494
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,399
I cook. But from what I can tell,
you are just a drug addict.

495
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,594
You are a pathetic junkie,
too stupid to understand and follow...

496
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,190
...simple rudimentary instructions.
Too stupid to re--

497
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,399
Do it.

498
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,799
Try not to touch anything.

499
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,232
Want some breakfast?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

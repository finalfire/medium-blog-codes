00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:05,732
They found a notebook.

3
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,356
I made a copy for you
in case you're interested.

4
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:10,926
It pertains to some
methamphetamine superlab.

5
00:00:11,025 --> 00:00:12,818
Money!

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,130
What are we saying
is the source of this money?

7
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:19,953
Walt came up with a story
about gambling winnings.

8
00:00:20,058 --> 00:00:21,766
Blackjack, right?
Some card counting.

9
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:24,028
Actually that was Skyler's idea.

10
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,173
I think you are
behind all this.

11
00:00:25,255 --> 00:00:26,862
When the others find out
what you've done,

12
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:28,293
maybe we come pay you a visit.

<i>Ándale! Ábrelo!</i>

16
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,456
Did you want me
to open the doors?

<i>¿Qué estás haciendo?
¿Eh?</i>

18
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,353
Here.
The keys.

00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:42,828
<i>Take them.</i>

20
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:44,451
<i>¿Por qué me estás
hablando en inglés?</i>

21
00:01:44,568 --> 00:01:46,270
Why you talk English, huh?

22
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:47,605
<i>¿Qué?</i>

23
00:01:47,639 --> 00:01:48,874
No! No, no, no! No!

24
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,748
Ohh...

Gambling destroyed my life--

28
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,650
Me, my family,
everything I loved.

29
00:05:42,684 --> 00:05:47,254
It was like a robbery,
only I was the thief.

30
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,922
It's amazing, the stories
you tell yourself

31
00:05:49,957 --> 00:05:51,390
to justify it--

32
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:56,362
The lies that lead you
to just one more hand,

33
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:57,797
one more spin,

34
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:00,567
one more roll of the dice.

35
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:03,637
This is our deal, okay?

36
00:06:03,672 --> 00:06:05,840
Marie, no.

37
00:06:05,874 --> 00:06:08,777
You guys are not lifting
a finger. I mean it.

38
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:10,346
Yeah, we're bringing
everything, so--

39
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,549
This-- This is not
up for debate, okay?

40
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:15,485
Great.

41
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,287
Now, sweetie,
don't worry, okay?

42
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:19,022
We're not going to say
one word about the bills.

43
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:21,492
We just want to bring
everyone up to speed, okay?

44
00:06:21,526 --> 00:06:23,260
All right.
I'll see you soon.

45
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:24,294
Bye.

46
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,803
So...

47
00:06:31,837 --> 00:06:34,105
tonight's the night.

48
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,307
No turning back.

49
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:38,944
Well...

50
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:40,345
Okay.

51
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,880
Let's do this.

52
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:46,820
Okay, so first I assign
point values,

53
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:49,422
correlate
to the effect of removal.

54
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:51,124
You going to split the 8s?

55
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,027
Skyler, please.

56
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:55,729
Now,
the mathematical principle,

57
00:06:55,764 --> 00:06:57,798
known as the Kelly Criterion,

58
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,233
upon which I devised
my own strategy

59
00:07:00,268 --> 00:07:01,869
not dissimilar
to the MIT system.

60
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,905
Walt, you're not teaching them.

61
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:07,007
I thought you wanted me
to be thorough.

62
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,541
Just play.
You're taking too long.

63
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:10,576
What, you don't think
it behooves me

64
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,178
to be able to explain
any of this?

65
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:14,180
It behooves you to be a pro,
that's all I'm saying.

66
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:15,948
That's the fiction,
so chop-chop.

67
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:18,951
Don't chop-chop me.

68
00:07:18,986 --> 00:07:20,019
Walt.

69
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:22,889
Now, we both know
that the first decision

70
00:07:22,923 --> 00:07:26,859
is whether or not to split
or surrender on 8s.

71
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,393
Split 'em.
Mm-hmm.

72
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:31,463
Good on both.

73
00:07:31,498 --> 00:07:34,399
Next decision is whether
to double down or not.

74
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:35,467
What you should be doing.

75
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,903
On 11, yes. Double.

76
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,072
Okay, this hand over here,

77
00:07:40,106 --> 00:07:41,440
we have a soft 18.

78
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:43,409
The final decision
is whether or not

79
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:44,610
is to hit or to stand.

80
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:45,877
Hit it.

81
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,081
Becomes a hard 15.

82
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:50,148
Dealer has a 9.

83
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:51,383
I see that.

84
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,218
Hit it.

85
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:54,820
Oh.

86
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:57,189
Okay, let's see what I got.

87
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,760
And 21.

88
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,362
Damn.
Yep.

89
00:08:02,396 --> 00:08:03,429
Okay, this--

90
00:08:03,464 --> 00:08:04,764
The key thing to remember here

91
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,333
is that it's not about
any one hand.

92
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:10,069
The key is the number
of hands per hour.

93
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,070
Ooh.

94
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:13,106
Let's go again.

95
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,676
Zero, minus 1.

96
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:18,978
Okay.

97
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,816
Walt.

98
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,318
It's not as if I don't
know how to play.

99
00:08:25,352 --> 00:08:27,754
I certainly
more than understand

100
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:28,854
how to count cards.

101
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:30,089
Let's just keep going, okay?

102
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,425
No, you know what?
I'm in recovery.

103
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:33,460
Remember?

104
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:35,495
I shouldn't even be playing.

105
00:08:35,529 --> 00:08:37,330
And that is the fiction

106
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:39,599
that we should be sticking to.

107
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,901
You know what?

108
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:44,538
You're right.

109
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:46,674
Yeah.

110
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:48,275
- Wow.
- Okay.

111
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:51,846
Um, we're not leaving
anything to chance.

112
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:54,483
All right, let's get started.

113
00:08:54,517 --> 00:08:56,284
I've got a lot of, uh--

114
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,220
Walt,

115
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:00,421
we've got a lot
of ground to cover.

116
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,756
What is this?

117
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,358
We have to get
our stories straight.

118
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:05,093
We've got to be
on the same page.

119
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,261
Is this a script?

120
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,329
Bullet points.

121
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:08,963
Bullet points?

122
00:09:08,998 --> 00:09:10,599
Like a novella.

123
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,067
This is smart.

124
00:09:12,101 --> 00:09:14,269
You really want to try
to sell a DEA agent

125
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,271
some ill-prepared,

126
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,872
half-assed,
full-of-holes story

127
00:09:17,907 --> 00:09:19,407
about how we suddenly
have enough money

128
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,575
to buy a car wash?

129
00:09:20,609 --> 00:09:21,843
Am I supposed to memorize this?

130
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:23,611
We need to practice, Walt. Yeah.

131
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,547
We need to be
word-perfect.

132
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:26,548
Within reason.

133
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:27,749
We need this story to be solid

134
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:28,917
and sympathetic

135
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:30,853
and most of all
completely believable.

136
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,322
From a story that you
already told Marie

137
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,691
and you think that she
hasn't told Hank?

138
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:38,394
Ha! Come on. This is Marie
we're talking about here.

139
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:39,429
No, she hasn't.

140
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:42,032
She hasn't.

141
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:44,802
Hank thinks his insurance
is paying for everything.

142
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:46,237
Marie's not telling him

143
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,073
that we're paying
his therapy bills,

144
00:09:48,107 --> 00:09:49,307
and neither are we.

145
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:50,408
And why is that again?

146
00:09:50,443 --> 00:09:51,743
Really?

147
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:54,713
If we have
the gambling story...

148
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:59,084
Did you take money, Walt?

149
00:09:59,118 --> 00:10:00,919
You remember
Gretchen and Elliot?

150
00:10:00,953 --> 00:10:02,354
Because I seem to recall

151
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:04,390
that you'd rather
sell drugs than take help.

152
00:10:04,424 --> 00:10:05,724
Fine.

153
00:10:05,758 --> 00:10:07,559
Marie will tell Hank
in her own time,

154
00:10:07,593 --> 00:10:09,761
and at least we'll have
laid the groundwork.

155
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:12,597
And coming clean
with Hank and Jun--

156
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:17,568
Appearing to come clean

157
00:10:17,602 --> 00:10:20,437
will be the best thing
for everyone.

158
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:22,605
We talked about this, okay?

159
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,806
We agreed about this.

160
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,208
Yes, we did. It's just--

161
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:28,544
What?

162
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,313
Never mind. Just--

163
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:33,848
Okay.

164
00:10:33,882 --> 00:10:36,518
So I really think

165
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,520
we should tag team
the narrative, okay?

166
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,056
We'll each be responsible

167
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:42,423
for certain portions
of the story,

168
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:44,492
and then we can, uh,
we can hand off

169
00:10:44,526 --> 00:10:45,760
so we don't leave anything out,

170
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:47,596
and it'll seem
the most natural.

171
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,431
Okay, so I'm going to launch

172
00:10:49,465 --> 00:10:51,200
with the exciting news

173
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,702
that we are
buying a car wash--

174
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,104
Yay.

175
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,139
The next logical question

176
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,373
Hank will probably ask

177
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,942
is "Where are you
getting the money?"

178
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:02,010
Hmm.
To which I'll say

179
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:04,246
"We want to tell you
the whole story.

180
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,414
"It's a doozy,

181
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,616
so hold on
to your hats."

182
00:11:08,818 --> 00:11:09,918
Do you like that?

183
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,155
Sure.

184
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:16,224
It accomplishes two things.

185
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,392
It keeps it light

186
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,428
while letting them know
to expect something big.

187
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:20,862
Uh-huh.

188
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:23,765
Yeah. No. It's a doozy.

189
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,766
Hmm.

190
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:26,001
Okay.

191
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,437
Anyway, that's where
you will take over,

192
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,773
starting with your diagnosis,
pages 1 and 2.

193
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,675
Okay, and it's--
It's pretty much

194
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,243
going to run parallel
to the truth,

195
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,344
which makes it easier,

196
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:36,778
but, um...

197
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:39,481
just make sure to really
hit the cancer,

198
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:41,517
really touch
on the fear and despair.

199
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,785
It's good to remind them

200
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:45,720
and to get their sympathy
right off the bat.

201
00:11:45,754 --> 00:11:46,788
We want them to understand

202
00:11:46,822 --> 00:11:48,255
why you could do
something so stupid.

203
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,690
Now, after that,

204
00:11:49,724 --> 00:11:51,258
per pages 3 and 4,

205
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,494
after you say...

206
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,363
"Gambling became an addiction,

207
00:11:56,397 --> 00:11:57,898
and I just
couldn't control it."

208
00:11:57,932 --> 00:11:59,533
Do you see that--
Yes.

209
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,168
Right there in the
middle of the page? Okay.

210
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:03,103
Oh, and I put in
that line about robbery.

211
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,571
You know,
from the G.A. meeting?

212
00:12:04,606 --> 00:12:05,639
I thought that was good.

213
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:07,308
So next I'll chime in

214
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:08,843
about how it affected
our marriage,

215
00:12:08,878 --> 00:12:11,379
uh, starting with the,

216
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,714
uh, the deceit,

217
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,082
why we couldn't tell anyone.

218
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:17,119
"...terribly, terribly
ashamed of my actions."

219
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,320
Yeah.

220
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,688
There's two "terriblys"?

221
00:12:19,722 --> 00:12:21,089
It's supposed
to show contrition.

222
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:23,625
Well, I just wouldn't
use that word.

223
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,361
I would never say
the word "terribly."

224
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,663
Phrase it however
you want, okay?

225
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,164
You're jumping ahead.
Now--

226
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:33,834
And why--
Why am I so ashamed?

227
00:12:34,902 --> 00:12:37,003
Do I really need
to answer that?

228
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:42,642
I was and am providing
for our family.

229
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:47,780
Let's just pick up
where we left off.

230
00:12:47,815 --> 00:12:49,915
I'm weak,
and I'm out of control.

231
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,984
I mean, this whole thing
makes me look like crap.

232
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,387
This has to be
a warts-and-all story, Walt.

233
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:56,689
That's how we'll sell it,
and we both look bad.

234
00:12:56,723 --> 00:12:59,125
Oh, well-- How do you
look bad exactly?

235
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:02,228
Where is the "I slept
with my boss" bullet point?

236
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,431
I can't seem to find that
anywhere.

237
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:08,202
For a fired schoolteacher
who cooks crystal meth,

238
00:13:08,236 --> 00:13:10,638
I'd say you're coming out
pretty much ahead.

239
00:13:10,672 --> 00:13:11,939
I don't like it.

240
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:14,208
I don't want Junior
thinking less of me.

241
00:13:14,242 --> 00:13:15,476
At least you won at gambling.

242
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,877
I'm just the bitch mom

243
00:13:16,911 --> 00:13:19,412
who wouldn't cut you any slack.

244
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:27,687
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:32,257
I'm sorry that I put you
through all of this.

246
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,096
How's that sound? Hmm?

247
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,130
Here.

248
00:13:43,002 --> 00:13:44,402
Two "sorrys."

249
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,940
I believe we were on page 5.

250
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:52,076
So, after you say
how very sorry you are--

251
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,545
In your own words,
of course--

252
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,314
We're almost to the end,

253
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:58,850
and I say how proud I am of you

254
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,752
for joining
a 12-step program,

255
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:04,255
and-- And this is where
I think we should enact

256
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:06,191
how we're feeling, you know?

257
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:08,326
Just a--
Just a suggestion.

258
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:12,831
You might look down
on the floor with remorse.

259
00:14:12,866 --> 00:14:14,266
Hmm?

260
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:20,007
What? You don't
have to mean it.

261
00:14:20,041 --> 00:14:22,342
You just stare down
at your feet, Walt, okay?

262
00:14:22,377 --> 00:14:24,745
Then, uh, I'm gonna--

263
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,081
I was thinking
of taking Marie's hand

264
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,384
and saying something emotional

265
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:32,554
like "It's such a relief
to tell you.

266
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,423
"We're just so glad
we have a strong family

267
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:35,490
"to help us through this,

268
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,191
that we can all support
each other."

269
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:41,396
And then maybe
I'll tear up a little.

270
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,931
I don't know.

271
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,033
I'll just have to see
what happens in the moment.

272
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:48,670
You're going to cry?
On cue?

273
00:14:48,704 --> 00:14:51,205
I said I don't know.
Maybe.

274
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:53,240
When you dab your eyes,
you going to do it

275
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:54,808
with your right hand
or your left?

276
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:55,709
It's just an idea.
One tear? Two tears?

277
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,678
This has to be convincing,

278
00:14:57,712 --> 00:14:59,146
especially to Hank.

279
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,382
I'm doing the best
I can here, Walt.

280
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,251
And yes, I'm thorough.

281
00:15:04,753 --> 00:15:08,056
Maybe lying doesn't
come as easily to me

282
00:15:08,091 --> 00:15:09,558
as it does to you.

283
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,342
Hey!
Guys! Come on in.

284
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:28,943
Hi. Good to see you.

285
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,412
Hey. Put her there,
you little punk.

286
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:32,613
Hi.
Hey.

287
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,747
Great to see you, Hank.

288
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:34,848
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

289
00:15:34,882 --> 00:15:36,049
Oh, look at my little princess.

290
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,250
She's getting big, huh?

291
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:38,952
An heavy, too.

292
00:15:38,987 --> 00:15:40,921
Whoa, is that actual
food I'm smelling?

293
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:42,923
I might get an honest-to-God
meal here for once?

294
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,024
You look good.

295
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,193
Thank you, sweetheart.

296
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:46,494
Your aunt Marie, she's cute,

297
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,562
but she could burn water,

298
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:48,630
you know what I'm saying?

299
00:15:48,664 --> 00:15:50,699
You are so very hilarious.

300
00:15:50,734 --> 00:15:52,368
Go show the boys
your new rock collection.

301
00:15:52,402 --> 00:15:53,770
We're going to get things
organized.

302
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,071
Yeah, it'll be
about 10 minutes.

303
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,139
You have a rock collection?

304
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:57,774
It's a mineral collection.

305
00:15:57,809 --> 00:15:59,376
Uh, just a little
something I--

306
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,045
You guys want to see it?
Want to see it?

307
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:02,313
Sure.
Let's go see it.

308
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:03,514
Oh, hey, let me.

309
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:05,950
Hey, it's all right.
I got it.

310
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,386
Come on, guys,
it's down the hall here.

311
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,759
Now that one there,
that's Rhodonite, okay?

312
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:16,661
It's manganese inosilicate.

313
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:18,296
Cool.

314
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,331
What-- What makes it
be all pink like that?

315
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,334
Well, that's
the manganese part, okay?

316
00:16:22,368 --> 00:16:25,237
It-- It oxidizes,
you know, like rust.

317
00:16:25,271 --> 00:16:26,939
Exactly. Manganese can
have an oxidation state

318
00:16:26,973 --> 00:16:29,408
of between -3 and +7,

319
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:31,677
which takes it through
a range of colors--

320
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,845
Purple, green, blue.

321
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,215
But its most stable state
is +2,

322
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:37,617
which is usually pale pink.

323
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:41,153
So...

324
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:44,189
Exactly. Whatever
the hell he said.

325
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:48,460
Anyway, you, uh,
you get the idea.

326
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,896
Yeah, it's, uh, interesting.

327
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,864
Interesting stuff, that.

328
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:54,099
Really.

329
00:16:58,470 --> 00:16:59,704
Oh, hey, uh,

330
00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:02,273
here. Give me
that file, will you?

331
00:17:02,307 --> 00:17:04,276
You got to check this out.

332
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,312
I, uh, have been working
on something here.

333
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:09,548
Been a little, uh,
little consulting--

334
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:12,985
You know, weighing in
on a case for APD.

335
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,322
Put that in, will you?

336
00:17:16,357 --> 00:17:18,391
Put that in over there.

337
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:21,628
Uh, Hank, what is this?
It's not a dead body--

338
00:17:21,662 --> 00:17:23,697
No, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.

339
00:17:23,732 --> 00:17:26,200
You guys-- Seriously,
you got to check this out.

340
00:17:26,234 --> 00:17:27,601
This is good. Ready?

341
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,103
Here we go on here.

342
00:17:33,943 --> 00:17:35,844
Look at this guy.

343
00:17:35,879 --> 00:17:37,179

00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:46,255

00:17:58,968 --> 00:18:01,102
That, my friends,

356
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:04,205

It's such a relief
to finally tell you.

361
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:15,361
We're just so glad

362
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:19,999
that we have a strong family
to help us through this,

363
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,667
that we can all
support each other.

364
00:18:23,737 --> 00:18:25,438
Jesus.

365
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,173
I don't even know where--

366
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,141
Holy shit.

367
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:30,143
Yeah.

368
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,747
Walter H. Whyte.

369
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:37,317
Man of hidden talents.

370
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:41,054
Dad, you're such a stud.

371
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:43,623
How much did you win exactly?

372
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,027
Dad?

373
00:18:47,061 --> 00:18:49,596
I-- I don't think
I have exact figures.

374
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,064
It's, uh,
it's enough to--

375
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:52,799
Uh, after taxes,
of course--

376
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,468
To buy the car wash.

377
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:57,972
Maybe even pay for

378
00:18:58,006 --> 00:19:00,975
a couple of halfway
reasonable college educations.

379
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:04,378
Damn, Dad, why'd you quit?

380
00:19:04,413 --> 00:19:08,916
I can totally get a car
for my birthday now.

381
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,518
Right?

382
00:19:13,855 --> 00:19:16,390
Son, I'm...

383
00:19:16,424 --> 00:19:20,661
terribly, terrible
ashamed of my actions.

384
00:19:22,163 --> 00:19:24,365
Would you excuse me, please?

385
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,267
I need to use the restroom.

386
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,474
Wow.

387
00:19:56,766 --> 00:19:57,866
Walt?

388
00:20:08,644 --> 00:20:09,944
Hey. Whoa, whoa.

389
00:20:09,978 --> 00:20:11,712
Oh. Sorry. I--

390
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:13,380
I thought you might
have fallen in there.

391
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:16,683
Uh, no, no. I just, uh--

392
00:20:16,718 --> 00:20:19,654
Hey, man, that was
some big stuff back there.

393
00:20:21,423 --> 00:20:24,326
Yeah, we wanted
to be thorough, so--

394
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:27,263
Yeah, well, it's quite a tale.

395
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:31,735
It couldn't have been
easy to talk about.

396
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:36,073
You know, Walt, if you...

397
00:20:36,107 --> 00:20:38,742
you can always
bend my ear, right?

398
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:40,611
I mean, if you ever
need to talk or--

399
00:20:40,645 --> 00:20:42,380
Or just blow off some steam.

400
00:20:42,414 --> 00:20:44,849
I'm-- I'm here.

401
00:20:46,685 --> 00:20:48,352
Not going anywhere.

402
00:20:50,355 --> 00:20:51,455
Thanks, Hank.

403
00:20:56,127 --> 00:20:57,661
Same goes for me, you know.

404
00:20:57,695 --> 00:21:00,698
If you ever want to bounce
anything off me.

405
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:05,103
I don't know, case work,
anything, really.

406
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:07,906
Sometimes just talking
something through,

407
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,942
you know, really
can make a difference.

408
00:21:11,611 --> 00:21:13,045
I mean, we're
definitely not talking,

409
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,313
you know, bathtub crank here.

410
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,715
This is a big-ass
operation.

411
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,851
You know, hundreds
of pounds a week,

412
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,653
maybe more.

413
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:22,821
So, uh...

414
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:26,892
who is this person?
What do you know about him?

415
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:29,461
Other than the fact that he's
deader than a Texas salad bar

416
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,996
and has a decent set of pipes?

417
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,898
I'd say he's my guy.

418
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,201
Your guy?

419
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:38,571
There's this, uh, mystery man

420
00:21:38,605 --> 00:21:40,272
I've been, uh, chasing

421
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,708
for the better part of a year.

422
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:45,144
Cooks the purest meth

423
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,314
that, uh, me or anyone
else has ever seen.

424
00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:51,650
Goes by the name of Heisenberg.

425
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,454
Hmm.

426
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:56,689
Yeah.
Pretty weird, huh?

427
00:21:56,723 --> 00:21:58,992
I-- I--
I looked him up.

428
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,193
It, uh, it was one
of these physicists--

429
00:22:00,227 --> 00:22:01,494
One of Hitler's guys,

430
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,196
a physicist
named Werner Heisenberg.

431
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:05,731
Real cute, huh?

432
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:07,734
Anyway, I figure
with a handle like that,

433
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,669
you know, my guy's got to be

434
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,871
some sort of an egghead.
No offense.

435
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:13,672
And here we go--

436
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,642
Gale "Major Tom" Boetticher.

437
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:18,911
Anyway, I-- I--
I just want to see

438
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:22,014
if I'm, you know, not
barking up the wrong tree

439
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,383
chemically speaking.

440
00:22:23,417 --> 00:22:25,618
Uh, as far as I can make out,

441
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:30,189
he's writing about
phenylacetone cook, right?

442
00:22:31,624 --> 00:22:32,858
Yeah.

443
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,960
Yeah. That's pretty
rare these days,

444
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:36,494
but it-- It does jive

445
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,996
with the blue stuff
I've been tracking.

446
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:40,566
"2 sticks dairy free
soy margarine,

447
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,236
2/3 cup turbinado sugar"?

448
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,107
It's a recipe
for vegan s'mores.

449
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:50,244
Hmm. There's all kinds
of crazy crap in there.

450
00:22:50,278 --> 00:22:51,312
Yeah, like, uh, you know,

451
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:53,515
top ten recumbent bicycles,

452
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:55,049
indoor composting tips.

453
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:56,551
All right next to the--

454
00:22:56,585 --> 00:23:00,588
The mother of, uh, of
methamphetamine synthesis.

455
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,490
This guy was a, uh--

456
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,360
Man, he was a real character.

457
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:08,896
Yeah, he seems, uh, unique.

458
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,598
Here, let me-- Let me--
Let me show you something.

459
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:11,732
Give it-- Give it.

460
00:23:14,703 --> 00:23:16,304
Right here at the, uh--

461
00:23:16,338 --> 00:23:21,475
And here's the top.
It says, uh, "To W.W.

462
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,979
My star,
my perfect silence."

463
00:23:24,013 --> 00:23:24,980
Huh.

464
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:27,516
W.W.

465
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,319
I mean, who do you
figure that is, huh?

466
00:23:30,354 --> 00:23:33,190
Woodrow Wilson?

467
00:23:33,224 --> 00:23:35,258
Willy Wonka?

468
00:23:37,795 --> 00:23:39,496
Walter Whyte?

469
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:44,000
You got me.

470
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:49,539
W.W.

471
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:51,974
Hey, man, let me see this...

472
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:56,145
for a second because
I think I remembered...

473
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,948
Ah. Here.

474
00:23:58,982 --> 00:24:01,117
Yes.

475
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,321
Yeah.

476
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,024
"When I heard
the learn'd astronomer..."

477
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:09,894
Learned.
"And from time to time

478
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:12,631
"looked up in perfect silence

479
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:14,767
at the stars."

480
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:18,336
It's a poem by Walt Whitman.

481
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:20,405
Your W.W.

482
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:23,941
You frickin' braniac.

483
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:25,710
Ha.
You frickin' braniac.

484
00:24:25,745 --> 00:24:27,179
Ha ha ha!

485
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:29,414
I must have skipped that day
in school or something.

486
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:30,982
I don't know.
Hee hee!

487
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:33,117
I've been chasing my tail
about that one, you know?

488
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:34,085
I bet you're right.

489
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,354
Well, I'm glad
I could be of help.

490
00:24:36,388 --> 00:24:39,891
Yeah.
Walt Whitman, huh.

491
00:24:39,925 --> 00:24:44,096
So, uh, you think
this Gale person

492
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,497
is your Heisenberg?

493
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:47,867
Yeah, I think so.
I don't know.

494
00:24:47,901 --> 00:24:49,701
God, I wanted to get this guy.

495
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:54,006
It looks like you did.

496
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,744
No, I mean, you know,
me personally.

497
00:24:57,778 --> 00:25:00,380
I wanted to be the one
to slap the handcuffs on him,

498
00:25:00,414 --> 00:25:02,182
that kind of shit.

499
00:25:02,216 --> 00:25:05,352
Popeye Doyle
waving to Frog One.

500
00:25:08,223 --> 00:25:09,823
If I recall,

501
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:12,426
<i>at least from the first
French Connection,</i>

502
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:16,430
Popeye Doyle never
actually caught him.

503
00:25:16,465 --> 00:25:17,464
Ha.

504
00:25:18,567 --> 00:25:21,870
Yeah, I guess me
and old Popeye, huh?

505
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,938
A day late and a dollar short.

506
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,113
What about the person
who killed him?

507
00:25:32,148 --> 00:25:34,582
APD's problem, not mine.

508
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:35,850
Any leads?

509
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,285
My buddy Tim says

510
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,953
he's got some fingerprints
they're trying to ID,

511
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:41,456
and an eyewitness
saw a person of interest.

512
00:25:41,491 --> 00:25:42,758
Might get lucky there.

513
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:43,959
I guess somebody
knows something.

514
00:25:43,993 --> 00:25:46,762
They'll track down
the shooter eventually.

515
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:49,265
Jesse!

516
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:53,970
Excuse me.

517
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:19,494
Jesse?

518
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:21,363
What's up?

519
00:26:30,574 --> 00:26:33,710
I need to talk to you, okay?

520
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,084
Now.

521
00:26:41,118 --> 00:26:42,285
Go ahead.

522
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:49,558
Would you stop doing
what you're doing, please?

523
00:26:49,592 --> 00:26:52,427
When I'm done, yo,
that dude's next.

524
00:26:55,764 --> 00:26:57,165
What the hell?
What is wrong--

525
00:26:57,199 --> 00:26:59,801
I have some business
to discuss.

526
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:02,671
So discuss. Jesus.

527
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:03,973
Let go of me.

528
00:27:04,007 --> 00:27:06,208
Gale's murder is
being investigated.

529
00:27:06,243 --> 00:27:08,144
Uh, duh.

530
00:27:08,178 --> 00:27:09,612
And I have it on good authority

531
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:12,483
that they found
fingerprints at the scene.

532
00:27:12,517 --> 00:27:14,218
Not mine.

533
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:17,555
We done here?

534
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,957
No, we are not done here.

535
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:20,625
What if they are yours?

536
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,893
How can you be so sure?

537
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:23,795
Because I'm here, all right?

538
00:27:23,829 --> 00:27:25,830
Your brother-in-law's
got such a hardon for me

539
00:27:25,864 --> 00:27:27,498
that if the cops would have
found my fingerprints--

540
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:28,899
Shh.

541
00:27:28,934 --> 00:27:30,367
The cops would have
found my fingerprints

542
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:31,634
within five blocks
of that place,

543
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:33,670
they would have
picked me up by now.

544
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,572
What about the casing?

545
00:27:36,607 --> 00:27:38,875
Or casings? How--

546
00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:41,411
How many times did you
shoot him anyway?

547
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,084
Jesse, did you pick up
the casings?

548
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,720
Did you pick them up?

549
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:50,922
No.

550
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:57,729
Listen, uh, we've got
to go over this

551
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:00,299
step by step--
Everything.

552
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,367
I want you to tell me
exactly what happened

553
00:28:02,402 --> 00:28:03,769
from the moment you got there.

554
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:05,470
I got in, I got out.

555
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,673
No. No, I need to know
specifics.

556
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,407
Now, we'll start
from the beginning.

557
00:28:10,442 --> 00:28:12,743
You-- You drove there.
You drove over there.

558
00:28:12,777 --> 00:28:14,511
You went to his door, right?

559
00:28:16,881 --> 00:28:19,249
Jesse,
I need you to concentrate.

560
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,250
This is very important.

561
00:28:20,285 --> 00:28:21,719
Did you knock or ring?

562
00:28:21,753 --> 00:28:24,321
Knock or ring?
Uhh!

563
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:25,823
Knock.

564
00:28:25,857 --> 00:28:27,992
Okay, good.
That's very good.

565
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:29,727
Now listen.

566
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:31,962
I assume that Gale
answered the door.

567
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:33,263
Now what happened after that?

568
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:34,765
Did he recognize you?

569
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,968
Did you say anything
to each other?

570
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:38,336
Did you walk into the room,

571
00:28:38,371 --> 00:28:41,106
or did you shoot him
right then and there?

572
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
What?

573
00:28:44,443 --> 00:28:46,945
Who wants to make
a hundred bucks?

574
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:48,180
Huh?

575
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,010
Look, the kid's probably right.

576
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:08,078
If they had anything on him,

577
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,847
he'd be locked up already.

578
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,682
What about
my brother-in-law?

579
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,218
He suspects Jess--

580
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,353
Hell, he knows Jesse
is involved

581
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:17,389
in the sale of blue meth.

582
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:20,859
That was Hank's
one and only lead.

583
00:29:20,894 --> 00:29:23,395
Now what if he puts
2 and 2 together

584
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,631
and he goes after Jesse
for the murder?

585
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:28,133
He goes after him how,
on his Rascal Scooter?

586
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,904
Ahem. That, perhaps,
sounded insensitive.

587
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:35,507
Uh, but if he goes after him,

588
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,075
I'll sue his ass
for police brutality,

589
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,744
harassment, assault,
and 16 other things.

590
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,879
Now, the history that
those two have together

591
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,147
being what it is,

592
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,682
you got to figure
your brother-in-law's

593
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,485
smart enough not to go
down that particular road.

594
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,888
Goose egg, bupkis--

595
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,590
That's what the cops got.

596
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,892
I wouldn't worry about it.

597
00:29:54,927 --> 00:29:58,430
What else should I not
worry about, Saul, hmm?

598
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:01,133
Should I not worry
that Gus plans to murder me

599
00:30:01,168 --> 00:30:02,568
at the first chance he gets?

600
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:04,837
Should I not worry
that my drug-addicted partner

601
00:30:04,872 --> 00:30:07,273
doesn't seem to care
whether he lives or dies?

602
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,474
You should see his house.

603
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:12,444
It's-- It's like Skid Row.

604
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,647
He has actual hobos
living there.

605
00:30:15,681 --> 00:30:17,515
Now how long before Gus decides

606
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:19,316
that he's too big of a risk?

607
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,018
Geez, that Mike,

608
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:24,488
that grunting
dead-eyed cretin

609
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:27,024
sucker-punching me
in the-- In the face.

610
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,526
I've got Gus
wielding a box cutter.

611
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,597
I mean, Western Union--
Message received.

612
00:30:35,199 --> 00:30:36,266
It--

613
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,968
Let me ask you.

614
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,672
When did this stop
being a business, hmm?

615
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:43,307
Why am I the only person

616
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,877
capable of behaving
in a professional manner?

617
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,345
No, I--

618
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:53,750
No, any way you slice it,
everyone's in danger.

619
00:30:55,085 --> 00:30:58,321
I mean, how--
How can I protect anyone?

620
00:30:58,355 --> 00:31:01,023
My family, Jesse, myself?

621
00:31:01,058 --> 00:31:05,294
My name never comes up
with those guys, does it?

622
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:12,336
Meanwhile, we're buying
this stupid car wash.

623
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,540
Oh. Yeah.
That ship has sailed.

624
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,508
Bon voyage.

625
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,777
We are committed.

626
00:31:18,811 --> 00:31:20,912
We already told
our family about it,

627
00:31:20,947 --> 00:31:24,015
and now Skyler,
I'm sure she believes--

628
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,784
She needs to believe

629
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:28,453
that everything
is neat and tidy,

630
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:29,821
and she's telling herself

631
00:31:29,856 --> 00:31:33,058
that I work in this nice
quiet little lab

632
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,193
with a white lab coat
and a pocket protector

633
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:37,062
and when my contract is up

634
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,696
I'll just simply
hang it all up,

635
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,798
tip my hat, and walk away.

636
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:46,804
Oh, God.

637
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:50,342
How did everything
get so screwed up?

638
00:31:52,646 --> 00:31:55,748
Yeah, you do have a little
shit creek action happening.

639
00:32:03,891 --> 00:32:08,928
You know, FYI,
you can buy a paddle.

640
00:32:10,697 --> 00:32:13,533
This is a last resort
back pocket kind of thing,

641
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,802
but if you really
got to protect yourself,

642
00:32:15,837 --> 00:32:18,572
uh...disappear.

643
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,441
Poof.

644
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,877
Poof?

645
00:32:23,911 --> 00:32:26,345
There's a guy
who can make it happen.

646
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,415
Call him a, uh...

647
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,516
disappearer.

648
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:34,354
For a substantial fee,
and I do mean substantial,

649
00:32:34,388 --> 00:32:38,358
you and your loved ones
can vanish, untraceable.

650
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:41,261
I mean, he sets you up
with a whole new life.

651
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:43,630
What, like a...

652
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:46,467
witness protection
kind of thing?

653
00:32:46,501 --> 00:32:48,969
Beyond.
I mean, off the grid.

654
00:32:49,004 --> 00:32:51,004
New identities, new everything.

655
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,641
No one would ever
be able to trace you.

656
00:32:53,675 --> 00:32:56,844
Now, be clear,
this is an end game,

657
00:32:56,878 --> 00:32:58,012
if you get my meaning.

658
00:32:58,046 --> 00:32:59,680
I mean, there's no coming back.

659
00:33:04,653 --> 00:33:05,619
Sh--

660
00:33:05,654 --> 00:33:07,187
You want his card?

661
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,260
Ahh.

662
00:33:13,295 --> 00:33:16,430
God, there's got to be
something else that I could do.

663
00:33:17,966 --> 00:33:20,967
Some way to keep everything
from spiraling out of control.

664
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,636
Well, I mean,
from what you told me,

665
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,138
it sounds like, uh,
Pinkman is first up

666
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,107
in the imminent demise
department.

667
00:33:30,145 --> 00:33:33,447
Gus won't risk letting
the police find Jesse.

668
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:35,649
I know him. He won't.

669
00:33:58,173 --> 00:33:59,473
I'm not even kidding

670
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:00,941
because if you really
think about it,

671
00:34:00,976 --> 00:34:02,176
you can't even see it,

672
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,844
so how can you know
just how bad

673
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:05,079
radio frequencies
and microwaves

674
00:34:05,113 --> 00:34:06,747
and cell phones and stuff
are getting you?

675
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,415
I mean, you could be
strolling through security

676
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,019
at the airport on the way
to visit your grandma or--

677
00:34:11,053 --> 00:34:12,587
Wake up, bitches!

678
00:34:12,622 --> 00:34:13,989
And then you get waved

679
00:34:14,023 --> 00:34:16,058
through a full-body
X-ray scanner,

680
00:34:16,092 --> 00:34:17,726
and the next day
you could be dead

681
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,995
or dying from all the radiation
that they say is safe,

682
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,297
but there's no way.

683
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:22,965
It could be because
they have to deliver

684
00:34:22,999 --> 00:34:24,133
a concentrated dose, okay?

685
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:25,568
Enough to penetrate
through clothes,

686
00:34:25,603 --> 00:34:26,736
and so the accumulated amount

687
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,037
could definitely be dangerous

688
00:34:28,071 --> 00:34:29,371
to susceptible
individuals--

689
00:34:29,406 --> 00:34:30,639
Hey, yo.

690
00:34:30,673 --> 00:34:32,241
Especially if you're
from a rural area

691
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,876
and the ozone layer's
already thin-- Yo.

692
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,077
Because of the cow farts.

693
00:34:35,111 --> 00:34:36,445
Yo!

694
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:37,780
Oh, hey.

695
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:38,914
Will you make sure

696
00:34:38,948 --> 00:34:40,448
there's pizza here
when I get back?

697
00:34:40,483 --> 00:34:41,683
Enough for everybody.

698
00:34:41,717 --> 00:34:44,652
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I can do that.

699
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:46,354
I can definitely do that.
All right?

700
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:47,689
Not a problem, all right?

701
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:49,758
I can get the stuff,
the pizza and stuff,

702
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:52,762
but as-- As far as the
financial situation, you know.

703
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:59,569
Just hang on, hang on.

704
00:34:59,603 --> 00:35:01,537
Oh, yeah. You know,

705
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:04,040
and, you know, if there's
a concentrated dose,

706
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,308
it's really-- It's gonna--

707
00:35:05,342 --> 00:35:07,677
It's gonna play hob
with your bone marrow,

708
00:35:07,712 --> 00:35:09,145
and it's really
gonna mess up--

709
00:35:21,759 --> 00:35:23,827
Because-- Because--
Because, especially,

710
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:25,929
if you have cancer,
and you know,

711
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:29,399
because if you got to get
a bone marrow transplant,

712
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:31,034
your odds are-- Are 60%.

713
00:35:31,068 --> 00:35:32,335
You have a 60% chance.

714
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,004
Hey.

715
00:35:34,038 --> 00:35:35,171
Oh.

716
00:35:36,707 --> 00:35:39,042
Hey. Hey!

717
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:41,278
Get some dipping sticks
too, yo.

718
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:44,214
Uh, I can-- I can
definitely get dipping sticks.

719
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:46,717
All right. I can get them.

720
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:07,733
Hey. Smoke it up,
bitches.

721
00:37:58,488 --> 00:37:59,722
<i>Gotcha!</i>

722
00:38:32,994 --> 00:38:34,127
Wake up.

723
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,498
Wake up.

724
00:38:42,303 --> 00:38:43,570
What's up?

725
00:38:46,774 --> 00:38:49,209
What's up with your ear?

726
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,044
Downstairs now.

727
00:38:57,985 --> 00:38:59,652
Where is everybody?

728
00:38:59,686 --> 00:39:01,954
I invited your guests to leave.

729
00:39:10,162 --> 00:39:12,163
Know who this is?

730
00:39:12,198 --> 00:39:13,531
No.

731
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:14,766
You ought to.

732
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,369
He's been at your house
for three solid days.

733
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:18,938
Okay.

734
00:39:18,972 --> 00:39:20,806
He stole your money.

735
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Okay.

736
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,680
That $78,000 or so
look familiar?

737
00:39:27,714 --> 00:39:28,948
This is it?

738
00:39:28,983 --> 00:39:29,983
That's it.

739
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,222
Okay, thanks.

740
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,361
You want to know what's next

741
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:43,262
for Little Miss
Pissed In His Pants?

742
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,263
No.

743
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:45,264
You sure now?

744
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,465
Yep.

745
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,001
Don't even want
to take a wild guess?

746
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:53,805
You're gonna kill him.

747
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:57,009
Is this the part where I'm
supposed to beg you

748
00:39:57,043 --> 00:39:58,844
not to do it?

749
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:01,380
Aw, please, please.

750
00:40:01,414 --> 00:40:03,482
And then what?

751
00:40:03,516 --> 00:40:06,920
I'm supposed to promise,
cross my heart,

752
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:08,855
to, like, straighten up
and fly right

753
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:10,824
or toe the line
or some other crap

754
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:12,226
that I'm not gonna say?

755
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,863
Is that what your little show
here was all about?

756
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:19,834
You're on thin ice,
you little shit head.

757
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:21,369
You know that?

758
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:26,875
You ain't gonna
smoke that dude in there.

759
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:28,643
You know how come I know?

760
00:40:28,678 --> 00:40:30,245
Because you went to the trouble

761
00:40:30,279 --> 00:40:32,081
of putting a blindfold on him.

762
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,189
I'm going back to bed.

763
00:40:39,223 --> 00:40:41,091
Let yourselves out.

764
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:54,372
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

765
00:40:56,308 --> 00:40:57,875
How's the ear?

766
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,143
Mending.

767
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,551
What can I do for you?

768
00:41:08,585 --> 00:41:10,119
It's Pinkman.

769
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:12,888
He's become increasingly
incautious.

770
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:16,225
He's a risk, a liability.

771
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:18,494
I know he and Walter
come as a team

772
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:20,830
and that Walter won't like it.

773
00:41:20,864 --> 00:41:23,665
But something's got to be done.

774
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,237
Got to be kidding me.

775
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,814
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

776
00:42:09,848 --> 00:42:11,382
<i>Wait for the thing.</i>

777
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:16,087
All right,
this is message number 3.

778
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:17,922
You better be ready
in two minutes

779
00:42:17,956 --> 00:42:19,989
because I am right outside
your door.

780
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:25,428
Jesse!

781
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:29,665
Jesse!

782
00:42:34,638 --> 00:42:35,671
Damn it.

783
00:42:41,411 --> 00:42:43,779
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

784
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:44,980
Oh, great.

785
00:42:48,518 --> 00:42:49,785
Jesse!

786
00:42:49,819 --> 00:42:52,054
Oh, this is perfect.

787
00:42:52,088 --> 00:42:54,623
You are a piece of work,
you know that?

788
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:08,540
Jesse?

789
00:43:12,346 --> 00:43:13,346
Jesse.

790
00:43:16,816 --> 00:43:18,183
Jesse?

791
00:43:44,946 --> 00:43:47,981
<i>Hey, it's me.
Wait for the thing.</i>

792
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:13,006
Where is he?

793
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:35,292
Going to ask where we're going?

794
00:44:37,328 --> 00:44:38,595
Nope.

795

Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:04,841
Let Mr. White go.
Don't kill him.

3
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,095
- You know that won't work.
- Then you've got a problem.

4
00:00:07,224 --> 00:00:08,878
I've got nothing to
say to you, man.

5
00:00:10,114 --> 00:00:16,662
I will kill your wife. I will kill your
son. I will kill your infant daughter.

6
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:19,031
You're gonna get new social's, new
identities. It's gonna cost you.

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:20,911
I've got the money.
Now I need you to call the DEA.

8
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:22,461
Gus has a hit out on Hank.

9
00:00:23,586 --> 00:00:25,111
Where is the money!?

10
00:00:25,186 --> 00:00:26,686
I gave it to Ted.

11
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:03,982
They're here.
They're out front.

12
00:01:04,016 --> 00:01:05,016
- How many?
- Four.

13
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:06,384
Nelson Brey, three others.

14
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:07,918
- Did you get his toothbrush?
- Got it.

15
00:01:07,952 --> 00:01:10,120
What about your stuff?
Oh, you know what?

16
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,025
We'll talk to them about
stopping at your place.

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,894
Skyler-- Skyler...

18
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:16,229
- What?
- I'm not going.

19
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:17,500
What?

20
00:01:17,534 --> 00:01:18,968
I'm not going
to Hank and Marie's.

21
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,002
I'm not going anywhere.

22
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:21,137
But you said we're in danger.

23
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,373
Yes, that's true.

24
00:01:22,407 --> 00:01:23,974
- Because of me.
- It doesn't matter now.

25
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:25,376
All that matters is--

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,244
All that matters is that
the rest of you are safe,

27
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,080
and that's why
I'm not going with you.

28
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:31,583
I'm the real target.

29
00:01:31,617 --> 00:01:33,486
But we'll all be safer
at Hank's.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,854
- That's--
- No, no, no.

31
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:37,690
No one will be safe
at Hank's if I'm there.

32
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:39,491
Walt, it's DEA.

33
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,894
Skyler, you don't know
these people.

34
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:44,495
- I--
- No, Skyler, please,

35
00:01:44,529 --> 00:01:45,696
trust me.

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:47,164
This is how it has to be.

37
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:49,099
Walt, those agents
outside--

38
00:01:49,134 --> 00:01:50,834
they're not going
to just leave you here!

39
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,203
It's called protective custody.

40
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,639
All they know is that
Hank is the only person

41
00:01:54,673 --> 00:01:56,507
that's in danger.

42
00:01:56,542 --> 00:01:58,809
They're including us only
as a courtesy to Marie,

43
00:01:58,844 --> 00:01:59,944
just to keep her happy.

44
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:01,345
How am I supposed
to explain that to Marie--

45
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,484
or Junior or Hank,
for that matter?

46
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:07,953
I don't know, but you'll do it.

47
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:09,355
You'll figure it out.

48
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,226
Hank knows that Marie
will be overreacting.

49
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,029
Except she's not.

50
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:21,068
I'll talk to Hank.

51
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,804
You just back me up
with everyone else.

52
00:02:22,838 --> 00:02:24,106
You really expect me to say

53
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,441
"Okay, Walt, sure,
just stay here and..."

54
00:02:28,211 --> 00:02:31,646
No, there's got to be
another way.

55
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:33,948
There isn't.

56
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,651
There was,

57
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:38,686
but now there isn't.

58
00:02:41,757 --> 00:02:43,891
Walt,

59
00:02:43,926 --> 00:02:46,193
how long till you're safe,

60
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:47,628
till you can work this out?

61
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,101
Oh, Skyler...

62
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:57,640
- Skyler--
-

63
00:02:57,675 --> 00:03:02,345
I have lived under the threat
of death for a year now,

64
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,549
and because of that,

65
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:06,683
I've made choices.

66
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:09,120
- Walt--
- Listen to me.

67
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:12,490
I alone should suffer
the consequences

68
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,492
of those choices, no one else.

69
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:16,961
And those consequences--

70
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,464
they're coming.

71
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:25,970
No more prolonging
the inevitable.

72
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,716
Feed that belt-- yep, right
through those seatbelt holders

73
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,151
- Thank you so much.
[chuckling] - Hank,

74
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,686
I've got a car wash to run.

75
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,421
I mean,
you don't honestly believe

76
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,790
that I'm in danger,
do you? Me?

77

00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,736
and let Steve Gomez know.

83
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:58,839
I told some of his guys,
and just stay safe.

[Walter, Jr.] He's going to risk
his life over a stupid car wash?

101
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,587
Does he even understand

102
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:29,721
what's going on
with Uncle Hank?

103

He'll come when he's able.

00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:32,858
That's pathetic.

How hard did you even try,
or did you?

[Hank] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Lay off your mom.

Well, you know, Hank, we wouldn't
even be arguing about this

108
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:44,803
if you and Steve
would just make him come.

109
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,238
Why didn't your people
put him in the car?

110
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:48,339
Uh, because it's not
Nazi German, all right?

Oh, pl-- you--
Nazi Germany.

If I had a dollar
for every time I heard that.

113
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:54,245
You know what?
I'm going to call him.

114

He's going to get
his behind here immediately.

Thank you. At least somebody

Because we are all
in danger here.

We are not all in danger.

119
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,122
Will you stop saying that?

120
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,925
That is asking for trouble.

He's not picking up.

Look, could we just take
this down a notch?

Okay, everybody?

We've got plenty of room.

But I wouldn't worry

00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:28,410
about any danger to Walt
or any of us.

129

Okay?

130
00:08:30,213 --> 00:08:33,215
This whole thing's
just a damn smoke screen.

131
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,084
How do you mean
a-- a smoke screen?

132
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,020
An anonymous threat against me?

133
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,957
I'm stuck in a wheelchair.
I'm not even on the job.

No, someone doesn't like the way
I've been spending my free time.

What, minerals?

00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:51,970
Timing seem a bit odd
to you, huh?

137
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:53,705
I mean, I start looking
into, you know...

138
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:57,742
Fring, and all of a sudden
I'm under lockdown for my own protection?

139
00:08:57,776 --> 00:08:59,710
Wait a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

140
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:01,244
Gus Fring?

141
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,646
From the chicken restaurant?

142
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,414
Hank, what are
you talking about?

143
00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:06,383
[sighs]

144
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:08,151
Just one man's humble opinion.

145
00:09:08,185 --> 00:09:09,419
That's all,

146
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,354
but I think Los Pollos Hermanos

147
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:13,357
is a front for the biggest
meth distributor

148
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,391
in the Southwest.

[Marie] - Oh, my God.
[Skyler] - Steve...

150
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:19,030
- Oh, my God.
Are you-- Are you even looking into this?

151
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,264
[Gomez] We're looking
into everything,

152
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:22,600
but we work on fact,
not conjecture,

153
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:24,035
and the fact is

154
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,871
that the scumbags
that hit you first

155
00:09:25,905 --> 00:09:27,139
were Mexican cartel,

156
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,242
not some German multinational
whatever,

157
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:32,310
and definitely
not Colonel Sanders.

158
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,646
Now, if we even had
a shred of proof--

159
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,881
Isn't that what you
get paid to go get?

160
00:09:38,217 --> 00:09:40,151
Remember that laundry

Not for you.
No, no problem.

- I bust this chef.

Well, he says he's a chef,

188
00:11:03,002 --> 00:11:04,503
but just because you work
at a restaurant

189
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:06,538
that charges $14 for a burger,

190
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:08,073
that don't make you a chef.

191
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:10,542
That makes you
a glorified burger flipper,

192
00:11:10,576 --> 00:11:11,743
at least in my book.

193

- Yeah.
[chuckles] - Anyway,

194
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:15,514
so we bust this chef--
heroin possession.

195
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:17,416
He says, "Well, just
because you found heroin

00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:20,187
"in my chef whites

whites"-- this place.

to do this stuff with you.

I-I know, I know.

201

You don't have to say it.
I'll say it for you.

202
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:32,467
His story is a big load
of steaming horse shit.

203
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,602
I mean, we're going to
find heroin here

204
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:37,538
like we're going to find
Jimmy Hoffa. Right?

205
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:40,007
The thing is,
is that the chef's daddy

206
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:42,243
is a United States Senator.

207
00:11:42,277 --> 00:11:43,777
I'm not going to tell you
which one,

208
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,479
but you probably know
who he is, right?

209
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:47,581
So now I've got to waste
my time

210
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:50,050
checking out
this burger flipper's story,

211
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,419

Listen, you know what?

216
00:12:00,329 --> 00:12:02,030

00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:04,634
and I can't promise I'll reach him
anytime soon either, you know?

218
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:06,802
Well, yeah, that's probably
the way to go,

219
00:12:06,837 --> 00:12:08,437
so I'll have to go get
a warrant,

220
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:10,106
and we'll do it official,

221

00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:30,911
Well, inside of an hour,
that's going to be me, okay?

321
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:33,214
I'm hitting the road.
I'm gone. I'm out of here.

322
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:35,383
What, for, like, good?

323
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,818
For as long as it takes.

324
00:19:36,853 --> 00:19:39,421
I don't like my heat so hot,
if you catch my drift.

325
00:19:39,456 --> 00:19:41,891
I'm not catching, like,
anything you're saying,

326
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:43,159
and what the hell
is your problem?

327
00:19:43,193 --> 00:19:45,094
You haven't talked
to your partner, have you?

328
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,897
No, not since last night.

329
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:48,766
Today he didn't show up
to work,

330
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,168
and the DEA just happened
to, like, raid us.

331
00:19:51,203 --> 00:19:55,373
Yeah, some coincidence, huh?

332
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,874
Yeah, I don't know about that.

333
00:19:56,909 --> 00:19:59,177
All I know is when he tells me

334
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:01,113
that your employer
took him out in the desert

335
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,714
and threatened to murder
his entire family,

336
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:03,982
I sit up and take notice

337
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:06,518
because, hey, after all,
what am I if not family?

338
00:20:06,553 --> 00:20:08,253
What are you--
What are you talking about?

339
00:20:08,288 --> 00:20:09,588
When did that happen?

340
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:12,991
I don't know. Forget it.

341
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:15,494
He-- He exaggerates, right?
He does that.

342
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:17,496
Hey, listen, do me a favor.

343
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,632
Would you put in a good word
for me with Fring?

344
00:20:19,666 --> 00:20:23,069
I mean,
just for old time's sake.

345
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:25,939
I can't afford to butter
the wrong bread here.

346
00:20:25,973 --> 00:20:28,042
[panting]

347
00:20:28,076 --> 00:20:29,710
Yeah.

348
00:20:58,206 --> 00:20:59,473
Hey.

349
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:00,942
Hey.

350
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:05,045
Nothing, huh?

351
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,513
[Hank] Clean as a whistle,

352
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,415
so he says.

353
00:21:25,865 --> 00:21:26,965
<i>[answering machine beeps]</i>

354
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:28,232

359
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,641
It's me again.

360
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:38,143
I really wish you'd pick up.

361
00:21:42,249 --> 00:21:44,918
God, I just--

[sighs]

363
00:21:46,254 --> 00:21:48,255
Call me back, okay?

364
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:51,859
Just-- Just call me back,
please.

365
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:13,279
Hi, I'm sorry. Is it okay if I
come out here for a few minutes?

366
00:22:15,081 --> 00:22:17,049
Yeah, sure, just stay
up here, if you would.

367
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:33,399
Excuse me, I wonder if you
have a-- an extra cigarette?

368
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,202
I sure could use a smoke
right about now.

369
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:37,937
Sure.

370
00:22:41,108 --> 00:22:42,942
Thank you.

371
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:50,383
Thanks.

[cell phone buzzing]

373
00:23:27,858 --> 00:23:29,558
Hey, what's up?

374
00:23:32,296 --> 00:23:33,663
What?

375
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,964
Hey-- Hey--

376
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,001
What's wrong with him?

377
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:42,604
What hospital?

378
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:48,409
Andrea.

379
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:50,544
Jesse.

380
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,045
Where's Brock?
They've got him inside.

381
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,180
Grandma's with him.

382
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,682
They got me filling out
all this paperwork--

383
00:23:55,717 --> 00:23:57,551
How's he doing?
Tell me what's going on?

384
00:23:57,585 --> 00:24:01,155
The doctors-- they don't
know what it is exactly.

385
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,958
It's like-- It's like
he's got the flu,

386
00:24:03,992 --> 00:24:06,660
but-- but he just keeps
getting worse.

387
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:07,928
Oh...

388
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:13,802
Jess, I don't understand.

389
00:24:13,837 --> 00:24:15,604
He was fine this morning.

390
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:19,741
He was fine.

391
00:24:19,776 --> 00:24:22,811
[sobbing]

392
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,847
- Andrea Cantillo?
- Right here.

393
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,815
Ms. Cantillo,
we're going to go ahead

394
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,318
and admit your son
to the pediatric ICU.

395
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:31,554
- You can bring that with you.
- Okay.

396
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:33,022
So you're the boy's father?

397
00:24:33,057 --> 00:24:35,559
- No.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

398
00:24:35,593 --> 00:24:37,962
It's just we try to keep it to
two visitors maximum, so-- okay?

399
00:24:37,996 --> 00:24:39,796
No, go, go.
I'll be out here if you need me.

400
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:41,065
Go, go ahead.

401
00:25:09,994 --> 00:25:11,661
No.

402
00:25:11,696 --> 00:25:14,064
No, no.

403
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,466
No. No.

404
00:25:16,501 --> 00:25:18,502
No... no...

405
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:21,773
Come on.

Andrea!

Hey, hey, hey, no yelling.

- Andrea-- I need--
- We can't have you back here.

413
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,797
No, I need to talk to her.
All right? I need to talk to her.

414
00:25:44,831 --> 00:25:45,964
You two,
just take this outside.

415
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:47,432
Would you please--

416
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:48,700
Brock is sick in here.

417
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:50,101
Come here--
Here.

418
00:25:50,135 --> 00:25:51,369
Jesse...

419
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:53,971
Jesse, what is it?

420
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:55,005
[whispers]

421
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,306
Jesse, I can't go.

422
00:25:56,341 --> 00:25:57,440
Brock stays in here.

423
00:25:57,475 --> 00:25:58,508
- Okay.
- What--

424
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,676
I'm-- I'm thinking Brock

425
00:26:00,711 --> 00:26:01,978
may have been poisoned.
Okay?

426
00:26:02,012 --> 00:26:03,713
What?

427
00:26:03,747 --> 00:26:07,350
There's this stuff,
this stuff called ricin.

428
00:26:07,384 --> 00:26:08,484
It sounds like "rice."

429
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:10,586
You need to tell
the doctors about it.

430
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:12,355
Why would you say that?
How do you know?

431
00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:15,125
It doesn't matter.
Just tell them it's a guess.

432
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,460
Okay? Ricin.

433
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:18,429
They'll know
what you're talking about.

434
00:26:18,463 --> 00:26:20,597
Jesse, if there's something
you're not saying,

435
00:26:20,632 --> 00:26:22,199
you've got to tell me--

436
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:24,368
Look, I gotta go.
I gotta go see some one.

437
00:26:24,402 --> 00:26:25,569
- Jesse.
- Look, I'm sorry.

438
00:26:25,604 --> 00:26:27,571
I'm sorr-- I gotta go.
Just tell them.

439
00:26:27,606 --> 00:26:29,206
Okay? Now! Just do it!

440
00:26:33,545 --> 00:26:36,347
Hello? Can you buzz me in,
please?

441
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:37,815

What do you want?

446
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:10,415
[Jesse] We need to talk.

447
00:27:12,518 --> 00:27:13,551
Who's with you?

448
00:27:13,586 --> 00:27:16,021
No one, just me.
Let me in.

449
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,671
I don't know what you're
thinking coming here.

450
00:27:36,407 --> 00:27:38,508
Oh, Christ.

451
00:27:38,542 --> 00:27:40,443
What does it matter?

452
00:27:40,478 --> 00:27:44,448
Everything, it's all--
all coming to an end.

453
00:27:44,482 --> 00:27:47,184
Do you even know
what's happening,

454
00:27:47,218 --> 00:27:49,419
the full scope
of what's happening?

455
00:27:50,488 --> 00:27:52,022
They took me out
into the desert.

456
00:27:52,057 --> 00:27:54,591
They put a hood over my head

457
00:27:54,625 --> 00:27:56,159
and drove me out
into the desert,

458
00:27:56,193 --> 00:27:57,227
on my knees.

459
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,163
They threatened my family,

460
00:27:59,197 --> 00:28:00,598
and not just Hank.

461
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:05,936
My wife, my children...

[whimpers]

463
00:28:11,276 --> 00:28:13,144
It's just a matter of time now.

464
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,851
I was-- I was able
to protect them for now,

465
00:28:19,885 --> 00:28:21,052
but...

466
00:28:24,223 --> 00:28:26,191
Gus is going to make
his move...

467
00:28:39,474 --> 00:28:44,010
and I don't--
I don't know when.

468
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:47,113
I don't know where or how.

469
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,584
All I know is
it's going to happen.

470
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:00,393
And I'm powerless to stop him.

471
00:29:06,334 --> 00:29:07,835
What are you doing?

472
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:12,373
Why did you do it?

473
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:13,542
Why?

474
00:29:13,576 --> 00:29:16,979
Jesse, Gus gave me no choice.

475
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:18,814
I had to call the DEA

476
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:20,049
to protect my family.

477
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:21,150
What else could I do?

478
00:29:21,184 --> 00:29:23,052
No. No, you son of a bitch.

479
00:29:23,086 --> 00:29:24,319
You know what you did.

480
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:26,454
Okay, look, just--

481
00:29:26,489 --> 00:29:27,722
just put the gun down.

482
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,891
Okay? Just put it down,
and we'll talk.

483
00:29:29,925 --> 00:29:31,158
All right?

484
00:29:31,193 --> 00:29:34,328
You tell me-- tell me what
it is you think I did.

485
00:29:34,362 --> 00:29:37,097
Brock--
why did you poison him?

486
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,732
Who's Brock?

487
00:29:38,766 --> 00:29:40,433
You saw him in my living room
just last night.

488
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:42,769
You came to my door,
and you looked right at him,

489
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,805
so don't tell me
you don't know him.

490
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,574
[stammers] The boy.

491
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:50,311
Jesse, I have no idea
who these people are.

492
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:53,648
Now, please--
Okay, that's Brock,

493
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,250
and-- and he was poisoned?

494
00:29:55,285 --> 00:30:00,789
The ricin! He's dying because
someone gave it to him,

495
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:02,558
and only you and I

496
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,359
were the only two people
on earth

497
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:06,027
who knew about it.

498
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:07,595
Now wait a minute.

499
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,829
Wait a minute.

500
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:10,097
Maybe he went into
your pockets and accid--

501
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:11,199
No!

502
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,933
I had it.

503
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,235
I had the cigarette
with the ricin in my pack

504
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:16,570
this morning.

505
00:30:16,604 --> 00:30:19,372
The last time I saw Brock
was last night,

506
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:20,640
and this morning

507
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:22,576
I switched the cigarette
into a new pack.

508
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,811
There's no way
Brock took it himself.

509
00:30:24,846 --> 00:30:27,248
Jesse, you're not thinking
clearly.

510
00:30:27,282 --> 00:30:28,883
Listen, you said it yourself

511
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:30,318
that you had it this morning.

512
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:32,721
Then when could I have
possibly gotten it?

513
00:30:32,755 --> 00:30:35,223
You-- You had Saul do it.

514
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:36,858
- What?
- Yeah.

515
00:30:36,893 --> 00:30:39,027
Yeah, I went to his office.

516
00:30:39,062 --> 00:30:40,962
He called me and just had
to see me today.

517
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:43,231
His big man-mountain bodyguard
patted me down.

518
00:30:43,265 --> 00:30:46,466
That's when he must've stolen
it off of me, right?

519
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:48,302
That's the plan?
Was that the plan?

520
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:54,942
Jesse, why?

521
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,579
[weeping] Why, in God's name,

522
00:30:58,613 --> 00:31:00,313
would I poison a child?

523
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:01,781
To get back at me.

524
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,452
Because I'm helping Gus,

525
00:31:05,486 --> 00:31:07,120
and this is your way

526
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:08,588
of ripping my heart out

527
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,557
before you're dead and gone.

528
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,526
Just admit it.

529
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,861
Admit what you did.

530
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:15,962
Admit it!

531
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:17,163
I did not do this!

532
00:31:17,198 --> 00:31:18,865
Shut up!

533
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:21,267
Stop lying!

534
00:31:21,302 --> 00:31:22,669
I'm not-- I'm not lying.

535
00:31:22,703 --> 00:31:24,304
I'm not lying.
Just listen to me.

536
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,074
Listen to me.
What would I have to gain?

537
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:30,711
What possible,
possible could--

538
00:31:30,746 --> 00:31:32,213
Who-- Who would--

539
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,086
Oh, my God.

540
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:41,089
[chuckling]

541
00:31:41,124 --> 00:31:42,557
Hey.

542
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,626
[chuckling]

543
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,894
Stop laughing.

544
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,697
Stop laughing!

545
00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:56,769
I have been waiting.

546
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:01,140
I have been waiting all day,

547
00:32:01,175 --> 00:32:03,143
waiting for Gus to send

548
00:32:03,177 --> 00:32:05,078
one of his men to kill me...

549
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:09,548
and it's you.

550
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,054
Who do you know

551
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:18,124
who's okay with using
children, Jesse?

552
00:32:18,158 --> 00:32:22,094
Who do you know who has allowed
children to be murdered?

553
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:25,030
Hm? Gus!

554
00:32:25,064 --> 00:32:29,300
He has-- He has been 10 steps
ahead of me at every turn,

555
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:31,269
and now the one thing

556
00:32:31,303 --> 00:32:32,403
that he needed

557
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,172
to finally get rid of me
is your consent,

558
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:35,340
and, boy, he's got that now.

559
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:36,541
He's got it.

560
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:39,377
And not only does he have that,

561
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:41,146
but he manipulated you

562
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:42,682
into pulling the trigger
for him.

563
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:45,619
Only you and I knew
about the ricin!

564
00:32:45,653 --> 00:32:47,921
No! You don't even
believe that

565
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:50,224
with Gus' cameras everywhere.

566
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,928
Please. Listen to yourself.

567
00:32:52,962 --> 00:32:55,631
No, he has known everything
all along.

568
00:32:55,665 --> 00:32:57,700
Where were you today?
In the lab?

569
00:32:57,734 --> 00:32:59,368
And you don't think
it's possible

570
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:02,637
that Tyrus lifted the cigarette
out of your locker?

571
00:33:02,672 --> 00:33:05,240
Come on.

572
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,141
Don't you see?

573
00:33:07,176 --> 00:33:09,877
You are the last piece
of the puzzle.

574
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:12,112
You are everything
that he's wanted.

575
00:33:12,146 --> 00:33:14,214
You're his cook now.

576
00:33:14,248 --> 00:33:15,949
You're the cook,
and you have proven

577
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:18,751
that you can run a lab
without me,

578
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:21,754
and now that cook
has reason to kill me.

579
00:33:23,124 --> 00:33:24,692
Think about it!

580
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:26,827
It's brilliant.

581
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,330
So go ahead.

582
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,467
Go ahead.

583
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:37,106
If you think that I am capable
of doing this, then go ahead.

584
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,309
Put a bullet in my head

585
00:33:40,344 --> 00:33:42,145
and kill me right now.

586
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,482
Do it!

587
00:33:47,618 --> 00:33:49,185
[breathes] Do it.

588
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,453
I'll do it.

589
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:51,821
Do it.

590
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:55,158
Do it.

I'm going to find
the son of a bitch,

594
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:28,358
and I'm going to kill him.

595
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:31,094
No, don't.

596
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:32,929
He'll see you coming.

597
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:40,304
You'll die before you get
anywhere near him.

598
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:41,572
I don't care.

599
00:34:41,606 --> 00:34:46,243
Jesse. Jesse,
just get in your car.

600
00:34:46,277 --> 00:34:47,878
Just go.

601
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:50,280
Just drive.

602
00:34:50,315 --> 00:34:55,118
No, I'm going to do this
one way or another, Mr. White.

603
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,856
Then let me help.

Oh, Jesus, Mr. Pinkman,

607
00:35:31,893 --> 00:35:33,694
I'm not going to keep
telling you.

608
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:35,428
Unless the family wants you
in there,

609
00:35:35,463 --> 00:35:36,763
you're not allowed.

610
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:41,000
You can't keep coming
in here like this.

611
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:44,536
You hear me?
You understand?

612
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:47,138
Mr. Pinkman,
I'm going to call Security.

All right, here we go.

00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:58,050
Come on now.

615
00:35:58,084 --> 00:35:59,718
Mr. Pinkman,
final warning.

616
00:36:30,753 --> 00:36:32,454
Hey.

617
00:36:34,624 --> 00:36:38,127
You need to be at work now.

618
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,229
I already told you.
I'm not going.

619
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,368
You've got a batch
that will be ruined

620
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:49,338
and an employer
who will be very upset

621
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:50,605
if that happens.

622
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,041
And I could give a shit.

has a problem with that,

00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:00,882
he can tell me himself,

00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:13,376
but, Jesse,
I am running a business.

650
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:18,247
I need you back at the lab
to complete the cook.

651
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:21,050
You can return
when you're done.

652
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,988
I can't.

653
00:40:26,022 --> 00:40:27,856
It is, as you must know,

654
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,724
in both of our best interests.

655
00:40:32,661 --> 00:40:34,229
That little boy upstairs

656
00:40:34,263 --> 00:40:35,897
is dying.

657
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:41,602
I can't be away.
I don't even want to be here now.

658
00:40:41,636 --> 00:40:44,672
I can't be away if
something happens, if he--

659
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,941
I am very sorry.

660
00:40:48,644 --> 00:40:50,411
Is there anything I can do?

661
00:40:50,446 --> 00:40:53,015
I am on the board
of this hospital.

662
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:55,651
I can recommend doctors,

663
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,655
make sure he gets
whatever he needs,

664
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,223
the best treatment.

665
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:03,995
He's not sick.

666
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,032
He was poisoned.

667
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,869
How did that happen?

668
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,707
The doctors--

669
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,777
they don't know.

670
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:28,119
[sighs]

671
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:34,293
This current batch...

672
00:41:35,362 --> 00:41:38,532
is surely ruined now.

673
00:41:38,566 --> 00:41:39,933
Correct?

674
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:55,881
Stay with the boy.

675
00:41:57,984 --> 00:42:01,654
Tyrus will dump what's there
and clean the tanks.

676
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:04,724
You will start a new batch

677
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:06,425
when you are ready to return...

678
00:42:10,831 --> 00:42:12,031
next week.

679
00:42:43,564 --> 00:42:45,264
There you are.

680
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,702
There you are.

681
00:42:50,471 --> 00:42:52,339
[beep]

682
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,823
Keep going.

683
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:32,077
Why'd you stop?

684
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,280
Why did you stop?

685
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:44,423
Why did you stop?

686
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,731
Come on.
Come on.

687
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:12,015
[groans]

688
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,472
Come on, come on.

689
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:39,310
Please. Oh, God, please.

690
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,945
Please.

691
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,800
No, no, no. No, don't go.

692
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:07,269
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

693
00:45:07,303 --> 00:45:09,605
No. No.

694
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:13,576
Oh, sh...

695
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:17,880
No.

696
00:45:17,914 --> 00:45:19,715
[panting]

697

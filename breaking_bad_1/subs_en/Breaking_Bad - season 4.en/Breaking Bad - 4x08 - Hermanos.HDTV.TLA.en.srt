00:00:00,046 --> 00:00:03,189
Previously on AMC's Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:10,254 --> 00:00:12,155
- He sees something in me.
- Like what?

3
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,236
Loyalty.
And maybe you got it for the wrong guy.

4
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:18,492
There's just one thing you and me
have to talk about. What's this?

5
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:19,527
This was you?

6
00:00:19,647 --> 00:00:22,608
- Where is Gus?
- Walter, you will never gonna see him again.

7
00:00:22,728 --> 00:00:24,811
I'll do it. I'll kill him.

8
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,443
What are Gustavo Fring's fingerprints
doing in Gale Boetticher's apartment?

00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:31,994

10
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,314
Are we done?

11
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,550
No, now listen, I, uh--

12
00:00:34,584 --> 00:00:35,619
This attack
on my brother-in-law,

13
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:37,755
I don't-- I don't know
what it means.

14
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:39,658
Please...

15
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,762
I fear for my family.

16
00:00:43,796 --> 00:00:46,364
I'm sure they'll be fine.

17
00:00:46,398 --> 00:00:48,999
I am told the assassin
that survived

18
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,300
is gravely injured.

19
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,569
It's doubtful he'll live.

20
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:55,904
Now thank me and shake my hand.

21
00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:00,913
Uh, thank you.
Thank you again.

22
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:02,447
You're quite welcome,
Mr. White.

23
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:12,062
What's happening?

24
00:01:12,096 --> 00:01:13,096
The time?

25
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,165
8:43.

26
00:01:15,199 --> 00:01:17,067
Time of death, 20:43.

27
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:20,603
Burn in hell,
you piece of shit.

28
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,613
<i>One suspected gunman</i>
<i>died at the scene.</i>

29
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:32,214
<i>The second succumbed</i>
<i>to his wounds</i>

30
00:01:32,248 --> 00:01:35,183
<i>earlier this evening</i>
<i>at an area hospital.</i>

31
00:01:35,217 --> 00:01:37,185
<i>Agents with the DEA,</i>

32
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,390
<i>in conjunction</i>
<i>with APD homicide detectives,</i>

33
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:42,159
<i>are working with Mexican law enforcement
in an attempt to identify deceased sospect.</i>

34
00:02:00,414 --> 00:02:02,316
I can give you highlights.

35
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:05,853
Your nephews grew impatient.

36
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:07,255
They continue to press me

37
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:09,557
for my permission
to kill Walter White.

38
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:11,325
When I wouldn't give it,

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,995
they settled instead
for DEA agent Schrader.

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:19,033
Their phone call was
placed to Agent Schrader

41
00:02:19,068 --> 00:02:20,401
moments before the attack,

42
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:23,071
thus giving him the upper hand.

43
00:02:23,105 --> 00:02:26,274
Marco was shot in the face
and died instantly.

44
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:29,577
Leonel lingered
for several hours.

45
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:34,081
The warning call
to the DEA agent--

46
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:37,419
Juan Bolsa may have some insight

47
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,521
into who placed it.

48
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:42,224
But yesterday, the <i>federales</i>
were at his hacienda,

49
00:02:42,258 --> 00:02:45,028
and in the confusion,
Juan was shot dead.

50
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,332
An accident, perhaps.

51
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:52,436
A mistake made by his own men,

52
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:54,839
though we may never know.

53
00:02:54,873 --> 00:02:58,609
At any rate, I thought
you should hear from me.

54
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,888
This is what comes
of blood for blood, Hector.

55
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,992
<i>Sangre por sangre.</i>

56
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,013
So is this the loud one?

57
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,151
What?

58
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:13,287
I can never remember.

59
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:17,491
Is this the loud machine
with the magnets?

60
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:20,761
No. This is
the PET/CT scan.

61
00:04:20,795 --> 00:04:23,396
Positron emission tomography.

62
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:32,104
They pair that with the computed
X-ray tomography.

63
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,542
Quiet. No magnets.

64
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,911
Right. Okay.

65
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,513
Yeah, thanks.

66
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,384
I'm still pretty new at this.

67
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:47,454
I mean, one minute
I'm starting a new business.

68
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:49,556
My wife and I are thinking
about having kids.

69
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,125
Walk into a doctor's office,
and suddenly, boom--

70
00:04:53,194 --> 00:04:55,929
Life as I know it--
Excuse me.

71
00:04:55,964 --> 00:04:59,366
Yes. I'm-- I'm waiting
to hear a progress report

72
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,234
on that thing we discussed.

73
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:02,769
So call me.

74
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:10,376
Anyway, so for me, that's been
the biggest wake-up call--

75
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:13,413
letting go, giving up control.

76
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,981
It's like they say--

77
00:05:15,016 --> 00:05:17,651
you know, man plans,
and God laughs.

78
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:22,590
That is such bullshit.

79
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:24,358
Excuse me?

80
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,729
Never give up control.

81
00:05:27,763 --> 00:05:31,466
Live life on your own terms.

82
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,669
Yeah. No. I get
what you're saying.

83
00:05:33,703 --> 00:05:36,939
But-- But, uh,
cancer's cancer, so--

84
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:38,840
Oh, to hell with your cancer.

85
00:05:38,874 --> 00:05:42,076
I've been living with cancer
for the better part of a year.

86
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:44,278
Right from the start,
it's a death sentence.

87
00:05:44,313 --> 00:05:46,079
It's what they keep telling me.

88
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:47,981
Well, guess what.

89
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,551
Every life comes
with a death sentence.

90
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:56,089
So every few months, I come
in here for my regular scan,

91
00:05:56,123 --> 00:06:00,026
knowing full well
that one of these times--

92
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,161
hell, maybe even today--

93
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,532
I'm going to hear some bad news.

94
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:11,071
But until then, who's in charge?

95
00:06:11,106 --> 00:06:12,339
Me.

96
00:06:15,511 --> 00:06:17,645
That's how I live my life.

97
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,401
This residue here
is why we descale

98
00:06:38,436 --> 00:06:39,670
with cool water
from the walk-in

99
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,138
and not water
from the tap, remember?

100
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:42,606
Yeah.
Do it again, please.

101
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,310
Pollos Hermanos,

102
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:49,112
where something delicious
is always cooking.

103
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,083
Yes, detective.

104
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:22,346
Gustavo, thanks for coming in.

105
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,647
My pleasure.
How's Kathi?

106
00:07:23,682 --> 00:07:25,349
Much better, thank you.

107
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:27,251
And you know Hank Schrader.

108
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,319
Ah, yes, indeed.

109
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:29,520
And Steve Gomez.

110
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:31,188
How was your meal?

111
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,656
Agent Schrader and I had a chance

112
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:35,125
to catch up in one of my restaurants
a few days ago.

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,393
I'd eat there every day,

114
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:37,761
but I wouldn't
fit through the door.

115
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:39,997
Well, should we get started?
Yeah.

116
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,467
I'd like to record
this conversation,

117
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:45,069
if that's okay.
Of course.

118
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,444
The DEA is working
on an investigation

119
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:55,146
which may overlap with my own,

120
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,214
so I've asked them
to sit in with us today.

121
00:07:57,249 --> 00:07:58,582
Gus, we all appreciate

122
00:07:58,616 --> 00:08:00,451
your coming in here
to talk to us,

123
00:08:00,485 --> 00:08:03,554
but you have the right to have
an attorney present also.

124
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:06,958
Oh, well, I can't see how
that would be necessary.

125
00:08:06,992 --> 00:08:09,193
But then again I have
no idea why I'm here.

126
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,828
So you wish to continue?

127
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,930
Please.
I'm very anxious

128
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:16,000
to find out what this
is all about.

129
00:08:16,034 --> 00:08:19,770
Sir, your fingerprints
were found at a crime scene.

130
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,305
Really?

131
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,107
That's surprising.

132
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:26,077
A drug-related homicide.

133
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:33,586
Gale Boetticher's apartment.

134
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:40,127
So you knew the victim.

135
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,304
15 years ago, I established
a chemistry scholarship at UNM.

136
00:08:49,338 --> 00:08:52,474
I named it after
Maximino Arsiniega,

137
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,710
a dear friend of mine
who died too young.

138
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,446
Gale was a recipient
of this scholarship.

139
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,850
He was, uh, perhaps
one of three dozen.

140
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,985
I see.

141
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:08,289
And Mr. Boetticher
graduated in...

142
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:10,558
1999.

143
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,726
That sounds right.

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,627
And you kept in regular
contact with him

145
00:09:13,661 --> 00:09:14,794
over all this time?

146
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,463
Oh, no. I hadn't
seen Gale for years

147
00:09:16,497 --> 00:09:19,165
until I ran into him
a few weeks ago.

148
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,667
Ran into him where?

149
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,069
At the restaurant.

150
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:26,039
Uh, well, "ran into"
isn't quite accurate,

151
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:27,307
as I assume he came by

152
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,808
to re-establish
contact with me.

153
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:31,344
We caught up briefly.

154
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:32,678
He invited me to dinner
the following night,

155
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,113
and I accepted.

156
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,752
It was, uh, perhaps a week later

157
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,120
I read about him in the paper.

158
00:09:40,155 --> 00:09:41,255
Drug related, you said?

159
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,691
It's a good possibility.

160
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,593
The paper made
no mention of that.

161
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:49,197
I assumed that it was
a random crime.

162
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:50,499
So after years with no contact,

163
00:09:50,533 --> 00:09:52,535
he shows up in your restaurant,

164
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:54,704
remakes your acquaintance,

165
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:55,772
and invites you to dinner?

166
00:09:55,807 --> 00:09:56,873
Yeah, he wanted money.

167
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,141
Gale Boetticher
asked you for money?

168
00:09:58,176 --> 00:10:00,110
He didn't come right
out and say that.

169
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:01,411
He spoke in terms

170
00:10:01,446 --> 00:10:04,648
of a vague investment
opportunity,

171
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,483
but it was my suspicion, yes,

172
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,785
as to why he invited me
into his home.

173
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,888
He was a very talented chemist,

174
00:10:11,922 --> 00:10:14,224
but for reasons
I never understood,

175
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:17,660
he was more interested
in taking shortcuts

176
00:10:17,695 --> 00:10:19,829
than what would
or could have been

177
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,531
a very promising career.

178
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,999
But personal shortcomings
notwithstanding,

179
00:10:24,034 --> 00:10:26,334
he was a warm, gentle person,

180
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:28,837
and I thought a lot of him.

181
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,407
At any rate, I, uh,

182
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,075
declined his business offer,

183
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:38,545
and, after what was
a very pleasant meal, left.

184
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:41,048
Can you tell us where you were

185
00:10:41,082 --> 00:10:43,450
on the night of Wednesday
the 23rd

186
00:10:43,484 --> 00:10:44,718
at around 8 p.m.?

187
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,854
Not an accusation,
just a question.

188
00:10:46,888 --> 00:10:49,156
Oh, I understand.
Let's see.

189
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,393
23rd.

190
00:10:53,428 --> 00:10:54,728
Ah.

191
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,432
I was at a fundraiser
at Presbyterian Hospital.

192
00:10:57,466 --> 00:10:59,867
I was there from 7 to about 10.

193
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:05,874
Anyone else?

194
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,446
Uh, sorry, yeah.

195
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:12,415
Just, uh, just one other thing.

196
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:15,519
Uh, is Gustavo Fring
your real name?

197
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:19,123
Is it my real name?

198
00:11:19,157 --> 00:11:22,760
I know you're a Chilean national,

199
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:26,764
but there are no records
of you ever living there.

200
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,032
Really?

201
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:30,567
I mean, records show

202
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:34,471
that you immigrated
to Mexico in 1986,

203
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:35,939
and then,
a couple of years later,

204
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:38,608
you were granted an entry visa
to the United States.

205
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:41,511
But there's no record
of Gustavo Fring

206
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:44,815
ever having existed in Chile,

207
00:11:44,849 --> 00:11:48,052
which I find--
I don't know-- uh, strange.

208
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:50,621
Well, really, it isn't.

209
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,257
General Pinochet's
government was guilty

210
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,491
of a great many sins.

211
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:56,426
First and foremost were
his human rights abuses.

212
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:59,430
But it was also
notoriously unreliable

213
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:00,497
at keeping records.

214
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:04,234
I'm sure, if you keep
digging, you'll find me.

215
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:09,573
Okay.
I think that's it, Gus.

216
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:10,675
Uh, thank you.

217
00:12:10,709 --> 00:12:13,078
I hope that I was
of some small help.

218
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,513
You were, absolutely.
Thank you.

219
00:12:15,547 --> 00:12:16,547
You're very welcome.

220
00:12:16,582 --> 00:12:18,515
Good to see you again.

221
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,150
Oh, no. No, please, please.
Thank you.

222
00:12:20,185 --> 00:12:21,185
Thanks.

223
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:27,490
Gentlemen.

224
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,658
So.. Are we buying?

225
00:12:51,898 --> 00:12:53,232
This thing with his name--

226
00:12:53,266 --> 00:12:54,466
what are you thinking there?

227
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:57,136
Sure, the record keeping
in South America

228
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:58,237
is hit or miss.

229
00:12:58,272 --> 00:13:00,340
I mean, we run into that
all the time, right?

230
00:13:00,374 --> 00:13:02,142
We usually find something.

231
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:05,245
I mean, before '86,
this guy's a ghost.

232
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,147
If the State Department
wasn't satisfied with his records,

233
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,348
they wouldn't have
naturalized him.

234
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:09,583
Well, maybe,

235
00:13:09,617 --> 00:13:12,052
but he immigrated
from Mexico in '89.

236
00:13:12,087 --> 00:13:14,689
You know, the state just wasn't
as tough on background checks

237
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:15,856
pre-9/11.

238
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,825
Regardless, I don't know
what this has to do

239
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:18,959
with the case at hand.

240
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:20,361
I was definitely curious

241
00:13:20,395 --> 00:13:22,930
when his prints show up
at Boetticher's apartment,

242
00:13:22,964 --> 00:13:25,366
but for me, the scholarship
thing explains it.

243
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,735
Well, I'll admit
to a certain degree of bias.

244
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:31,071
This man has been
a longtime friend of DEA,

245
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:34,007
but that being said, uh...

246
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:35,876
I thought his story was credible.

247
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,712
Well, I agree. I think
it was a good story.

248
00:13:38,746 --> 00:13:41,181
Still, why are we hearing it now?

249
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,316
What do you mean?

250
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,118
Well,
like you said, he's a--

251
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:47,287
this man's a big
law enforcement booster.

252
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:49,156
One day he's reading a newspaper

253
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,458
and sees that somebody
he just had dinner with,

254
00:13:51,493 --> 00:13:54,061
somebody he thought
a lot of, was murdered.

255
00:13:54,095 --> 00:13:57,331
He reads this, and he
doesn't make a phone call?

256
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:00,901
Doesn't call you or one
of his other cop friends

257
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:03,771
to share his connection
with the case

258
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:05,872
or ask about the investigation.

259
00:14:05,907 --> 00:14:08,308
We can't predicate
a criminal investigation

260
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:12,244
on a person
not making phone calls.

261
00:14:13,313 --> 00:14:14,847
What do you think, Tim?

262
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:19,117
Well, I want to follow up
on the scholarship, the alibi.

263
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:22,486
But my overall impression?
I believed him.

264
00:14:32,597 --> 00:14:35,566
Nice touch. Bird bath.

265
00:14:37,369 --> 00:14:39,035
Hey, tiger.
How's it hanging?

266
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,203
Good.

267
00:14:42,073 --> 00:14:45,142
Yeah. So, very nice.

268
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,711
What's the damage?

269
00:14:47,745 --> 00:14:49,213
1,200 a month.

270
00:14:49,247 --> 00:14:51,081
I did a lot of researching
for this neighborhood.

271
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,449
It's a pretty good deal.

272
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:54,585
You kidding me?
That's a great deal.

273
00:14:54,619 --> 00:14:57,121
Uh, speaking of which, ahem.

274
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,323
That's for the week,

275
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,858
plus there's a little
extra in there

276
00:15:00,892 --> 00:15:03,160
for any move-related
incidentals.

277
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,361
Thank you.

278
00:15:04,396 --> 00:15:07,097
Hey, champ, how's the new school?

279
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:08,799
Good.

280
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,468
I loved school
when I was your age.

281
00:15:10,502 --> 00:15:12,336
Seesaws, story time,

282
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,904
chasing girls with sticks.

283
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:15,239
Ha ha ha ha!

284
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:25,949
It wasn't until the fifth grade

285
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:28,386
that I found out
she liked me, too.

286
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,222
But by then her family
had moved to Scottsdale,

287
00:15:31,256 --> 00:15:32,323
so...

288
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:36,460
<i>carpe diem,</i> okay?

289
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:37,495
Okay.

290
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,930
All right, good boy.
Ha!

291
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:43,400
So, um, you'll thank Jesse
again from both of us.

292
00:15:43,435 --> 00:15:44,568
You got it.

293
00:15:45,937 --> 00:15:48,739
So is he-- How's he doing?

294
00:15:48,773 --> 00:15:49,806
Jesse?

295
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,414
He's good.

296
00:15:56,448 --> 00:16:00,117
He's, uh... he's busy.

297
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:09,559
How is it?

298
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:11,561
Oh, there's space, lots of light.

299
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,331
It's-- A little garden out back.
It's nice.

300
00:16:15,566 --> 00:16:19,436
And Brock? How's he doing?

301
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,406
Hey, look, I don't mind
dropping checks off

302
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,675
every week like Ed McMahon.

303
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,343
But if you really want
to know how they're doing,

304
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:29,712
why don't you go
see for yourself?

305
00:16:35,118 --> 00:16:36,552
I'll catch you later.

306
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,522
Hey, you going to need
a ride home?

307
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,234
Great.

308
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,043
Anyway, I'm proud
for not losing my cool.

309
00:17:34,077 --> 00:17:35,811
Plus it shows
our wipe-down crew

310
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,246
that I will support them

311
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,448
if a customer is being
really rude to them.

312
00:17:39,483 --> 00:17:42,952
You're really taking
to this whole be your own boss thing.

313
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:46,656
Yeah. I guess I am.

314
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,092
Actually,

315
00:17:49,126 --> 00:17:52,495
I'm thinking about making
a move up to management.

316
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,896
Mmm.
Ah, Jesus.

317
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,197
Corporate America, look out.

318
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:56,432
Oh, excuse me.

319
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,266
I would be a vast improvement.

320
00:17:58,301 --> 00:18:00,268
No one in Kleinman's
entire front office

321
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:02,804
knows the first thing
about giving an X-ray,

322
00:18:02,838 --> 00:18:04,806
which just-- ahh.

323
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,175
Hey, Dad, uh, whatever
happened with your scan?

324
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,445
Did-- Did you get
the results back?

325
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:13,783
Yeah. I did.

326
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:16,219
And I'm still in remission.

327
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:20,224
So you're all going to have
to be stuck with me

328
00:18:20,258 --> 00:18:21,292
for a while longer.

329
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:22,760
Cheers, buddy.

330
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,763
What about you, Hank?

331
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:27,264
How you feeling these days?

332
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:29,433
Well, I'm getting there.

333
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,434
The other day,
he had a big powwow

334
00:18:31,469 --> 00:18:34,437
with all the DEA
muckity-mucks.

335
00:18:34,471 --> 00:18:36,839
What was that about?

336
00:18:36,874 --> 00:18:40,009
Nothing. Just a dead end.

337
00:18:40,043 --> 00:18:42,177
He won't tell me, either.

338
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:44,313
Apparently,
it's all very hush-hush.

339
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,850
Hey, Walt, can you do me a favor?

340
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:50,853
Uh, Marie's working tomorrow,

341
00:18:50,887 --> 00:18:52,822
and there's this gem
and mineral show

342
00:18:52,856 --> 00:18:53,990
that's opening
at the fairgrounds.

343
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,694
I wondered if you can
maybe give me a lift.

344
00:18:57,728 --> 00:19:00,765
Yeah. Sure.

345
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,434
I had a collection of my own
back in high school.

346
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:04,469
I mean, nothing fancy.

347
00:19:04,503 --> 00:19:07,371
Just entry-level
beryls and garnets,

348
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:10,107
one passable black tourmaline.

349
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:11,875
Turn right here.
Okay.

350
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:15,912
But I did have one piece
of morganite

351
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,181
that was very special.

352
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:20,350
It had been heat treated,

353
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:22,619
so it had that classic
cast to it,

354
00:19:22,653 --> 00:19:26,923
that rose, almost salmon
hue, you know?

355
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,359
Hey, Walt,
there's no rock show, okay?

356
00:19:29,393 --> 00:19:31,694
I just said that
so Marie wouldn't freak.

357
00:19:31,729 --> 00:19:33,896
Take a right here.

358
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:40,403
Freak about what?

359
00:19:41,505 --> 00:19:43,505
Hank, where are we going?

360
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:49,945
You hungry?

361
00:19:52,315 --> 00:19:54,183
We're not here for the chicken.

362
00:19:54,217 --> 00:19:56,285
Kill the engine.

363
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:02,224
All right, heh heh heh.

364
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:05,160
You ready for your mind
to be blown?

365
00:20:05,194 --> 00:20:07,362
Uh, sure.

366
00:20:07,396 --> 00:20:09,832
Gustavo Fring.

367
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:11,600
Remember him?

368
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:13,736
He came down to the hospital
after the shooting

369
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,138
and put up the reward?

370
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,775
He-- He-- He sponsors
the DEA Fun Run every year.

371
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:20,177
You-- You've met him.

372
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,579
Yeah, the--
the Fun Run guy.

373
00:20:21,613 --> 00:20:23,081
Yeah, that-- that guy--

374
00:20:23,115 --> 00:20:25,183
Yeah. What about him?

375
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:26,885
Well, I suspect--

376
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:28,353
and I can't prove it, mind you,

377
00:20:28,387 --> 00:20:30,722
but I suspect...

378
00:20:30,756 --> 00:20:33,124
the man's a drug dealer.

379
00:20:33,158 --> 00:20:35,693
Hmm.

380
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:38,496
Yeah. Methamphetamine.

381
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,932
I mean, honest to God,
I really believe

382
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:44,434
that this guy's maybe
one of the biggest movers

383
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,736
in the southwest.

384
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,237
Remember Gale Boetticher?

385
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:49,573
The, uh, that sad sack
from the karaoke video tape?

386
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:50,674
Yeah.

387
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,676
And you said
that he didn't strike you

388
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:54,111
as being the boss-man type,

389
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:55,780
that probably there was
a much bigger guy

390
00:20:55,814 --> 00:20:56,914
out there, right?

391
00:20:56,949 --> 00:20:58,016
Hank, that was--

392
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,083
that was just speculation.

393
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:00,752
Doesn't matter.
It made me keep at it.

394
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:02,854
And guess what I find.

395
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:07,993
Chicken man's fingerprints
at Boetticher's murder scene.

396
00:21:08,027 --> 00:21:09,461
So we bring him in--

397
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:11,929
You think that--
that Gustavo Fring

398
00:21:11,964 --> 00:21:13,664
killed Gale Boetticher?

399
00:21:13,699 --> 00:21:15,299
Well, probably not.

400
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:16,767
I mean, these guys use, you know,

401
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:18,436
like, a dunce
to pull the trigger, right?

402
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,503
But his fingerprints being there

403
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:21,172
was enough for us
to bring him in.

404
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:23,741
So I--
So you brought him in to the police?

405
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:26,843
Right. He sits down
to talk with us.

406
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:28,278
The problem is that he--

407
00:21:28,312 --> 00:21:30,614
What did you ask him?
What did he say?

408
00:21:30,648 --> 00:21:32,215
Walt, will you let me
finish my story here?

409
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,953
Sorry. I'm just,
uh, interested.

410
00:21:35,988 --> 00:21:37,688
You know.
Yeah, all right.

411
00:21:37,723 --> 00:21:38,890
So we bring him in,

412
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:42,460
and he proceeds
to kick our asses, okay?

413
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:44,896
He's got an explanation
for the fingerprints, right?

414
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:47,298
He's got an alibi
for Gale's murder.

415
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,101
I mean, he's got reasons
for everything.

416
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:51,904
This guy is <i>Terms of Endearment</i>
convincing.

417
00:21:53,673 --> 00:21:54,974
So he's not guilty?

418
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,176
Well, as far as DEA
and APD are concerned,

419
00:21:57,211 --> 00:22:03,150
he's not. Officially,
Fring's not a suspect.

420
00:22:03,184 --> 00:22:07,220
Something deep down
says he's my guy.

421
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:08,888
Just got to prove it.

422
00:22:11,891 --> 00:22:14,926
Hank, why-- why are you
telling me this?

423
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:19,030
I need a favor.

424
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:21,899
What favor?

425
00:22:23,302 --> 00:22:25,870
See that Volvo station wagon
over there?

426
00:22:27,206 --> 00:22:29,474
I mean, the guy drives
a 10-year-old Volvo.

427
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:31,710
It's brilliant.
Anyway, listen.

428
00:22:32,846 --> 00:22:35,348
What I need for you to do...

429
00:22:37,351 --> 00:22:39,219
stick this on it.

430
00:22:42,324 --> 00:22:44,025
GPS tracker.

431
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:46,894
You know, wifey thinks
hubby's screwing around on her,

432
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:48,729
but she wants to be sure.
Hmm.

433
00:22:48,764 --> 00:22:49,997
You stick this on the car.

434
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,166
This part right here?
It's a magnet.

435
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,001
And see where he goes.

436
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:55,268
Cool, huh?

437
00:22:55,303 --> 00:22:57,604
289 from SkyMall.

438
00:22:58,739 --> 00:23:00,773
Unfortunately, it's not live use,

439
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:02,642
so we got to come back later
and, you know,

440
00:23:02,676 --> 00:23:04,610
take it off and stick it
in the computer.

441
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:07,713
Still, pretty amazing times
we live in here.

442
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:09,348
Hank, isn't that illegal?

443
00:23:09,383 --> 00:23:12,919
I mean, isn't there some
sort of unlawful search and--

444
00:23:12,953 --> 00:23:15,756
That's, uh,
known as extra-legal,

445
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,859
but trust me.
It's our little secret.

446
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:24,098
Look, it's easy, okay?
Here's what you do.

447
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:26,000
You untie your shoelace,

448
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:27,702
then you head
toward the restaurant.

449
00:23:27,736 --> 00:23:29,704
As you're walking past the car,

450
00:23:29,738 --> 00:23:31,873
you look down-- "Oh, hey,
darn, my shoe's untied."

451
00:23:31,907 --> 00:23:32,907
Okay?

452
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:34,009
Now, when you--
when you--

453
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:36,110
when you bend down
to tie your shoe,

454
00:23:36,145 --> 00:23:38,413
you, uh, you stick this
up into the wheel well.

455
00:23:38,447 --> 00:23:40,081
Then you go inside and,
I don't know--

456
00:23:40,116 --> 00:23:41,249
Hank, I-- I don't--

457
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:42,918
I don't feel good
about this at all.

458
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:44,954
Look, Walt, I-- I-- I know

459
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:47,022
that this sort of thing
is outside your comfort zone--

460
00:23:47,057 --> 00:23:49,592
No.
I mean this is a mistake.

461
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:52,494
Walt, I need you
to help me out here, okay?

462
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:54,163
I mean, this is really
important to me.

463
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:55,698
Jesus, just--
You make me beg you?

464
00:23:55,732 --> 00:23:56,999
Come on, just stick it in there.

465
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:06,476
Yeah.

466
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,712
Just act normal.

467
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:53,392
May I help you?

468
00:24:57,064 --> 00:24:58,665
I-- I--

469
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,734
Sir, may I help you?

470
00:25:01,836 --> 00:25:03,570
Look, I--

471
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:07,641
I didn't do it.

472
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:09,978
See? I didn't do it.

473
00:25:10,012 --> 00:25:11,513
Do it.

474
00:25:14,884 --> 00:25:16,685
Do it.

475
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,521
May I help you with your order?

476
00:25:20,691 --> 00:25:21,791
I, uh--

477
00:25:37,406 --> 00:25:39,406
What the hell is he--

478
00:25:47,248 --> 00:25:50,449
Just, uh, made sure
it was secure.

479
00:25:50,484 --> 00:25:51,517
Uh.

480
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,519
Where's my soda?

481
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:56,922
Just kidding.

482
00:25:56,957 --> 00:25:58,624
Let's-- Let's go.

483
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:30,267
Look, I--

484
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:32,573
I swear to God I thought
I was driving the man

485
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:34,027
to a gem and mineral show.

486
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,483
And all of a sudden he has me
pulling into your restaurant

487
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:40,258
and-- and-- and telling me
that he's investigating you.

488
00:26:40,293 --> 00:26:43,795
Look, you and I,
we've had our differences,

489
00:26:43,829 --> 00:26:45,030
but I would never--

490
00:26:49,035 --> 00:26:51,437
Look, m-my brother-in-law,

491
00:26:51,471 --> 00:26:54,240
evidence-wise, has nothing.

492
00:26:54,275 --> 00:26:56,643
He's-- He's operating
on pure conjecture,

493
00:26:56,677 --> 00:26:59,780
and no one-- not one person
that he works with--

494
00:26:59,815 --> 00:27:01,516
thinks that you are anyone

495
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,586
other than an owner
of a fast food chain.

496
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,988
But if something
were to happen to Hank,

497
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:09,657
then that would only draw
their attention to you

498
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,893
and therefore to me as well.

499
00:27:11,927 --> 00:27:13,795
So we have a mutual interest

500
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,499
in resolving this
without violence.

501
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:21,970
I will make sure
that he discovers nothing.

502
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:33,080
Jesse!

503
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:34,582
What?

504
00:27:34,616 --> 00:27:36,817
All right. Don't wait
to be, like, invited.

505
00:27:38,987 --> 00:27:40,320
Are we alone?

506
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:45,225
So where do we stand?

507
00:27:45,259 --> 00:27:46,760
Where do we stand on what?

508
00:27:46,794 --> 00:27:48,462
Where do we stand with the thing?

509
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:50,698
The thing that you were
supposed to do.

510
00:27:50,732 --> 00:27:52,466
I assume you haven't done it.

511
00:27:53,768 --> 00:27:55,202
You didn't lose it, did you?

512
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:57,204
You would tell me
if you lost it, right?

513
00:27:57,238 --> 00:27:58,572
Oh, Jesus.

514
00:27:59,574 --> 00:28:01,042
Asshole.

515
00:28:01,076 --> 00:28:03,511
You creaming to get it done?
Go do it yourself.

516
00:28:03,546 --> 00:28:04,779
If he didn't see me coming

517
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:06,915
like
he's some kind of--

518
00:28:06,949 --> 00:28:08,583
This-- All right, look.

519
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:10,685
Our timetable has advanced.

520
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:13,721
You have got to make
this meeting happen

521
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:16,825
this week, tomorrow--
tonight, if possible.

522
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:19,694
Oh. Tonight. Wow.

523
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:21,363
What are you, high?

524
00:28:21,397 --> 00:28:22,664
My brother-in-law--

525
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:25,868
My DEA agent
brother-in-law--

526
00:28:25,902 --> 00:28:28,071
He's on to Gus.

527
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:31,841
Huh.

528
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:36,112
Did you hear what I just said?

529
00:28:36,146 --> 00:28:38,014
My brother-in-law
is on to Gus.

530
00:28:38,048 --> 00:28:39,248
Ah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

531
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:41,617
Your brother-in-law, okay?
I'm thinking.

532
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:51,893
Look, uh, so what if this
is like math or algebra?

533
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:56,397
You add a plus douche bag
to a minus douche bag

534
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:59,099
and you get, like,
zero douche bags.

535
00:29:00,268 --> 00:29:02,302
I've got some math for you.

536
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:06,273
Hank catching Gus
equals Hank catching us.

537
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:08,809
Hank--
Geez.

538
00:29:08,843 --> 00:29:10,510
He's relentless, all right?

539
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:12,012
He won't quit.

540
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:14,314
Yeah, well, he's got nothing

541
00:29:14,349 --> 00:29:15,315
is all I can say.

542
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,784
Oh, and how would you know that?

543
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:18,752
Because he's still above ground.

544
00:29:18,786 --> 00:29:21,722
You think a dude like Gus
would let your boy

545
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:23,557
anywhere near him?

546
00:29:23,592 --> 00:29:26,761
He'll break out his box cutter
on his sorry gimp ass.

547
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:30,197
So you haven't even seen him

548
00:29:30,232 --> 00:29:32,099
since that time at the diner.

549
00:29:37,306 --> 00:29:39,307
Okay. Shh.

550
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:43,944
Think. All right.

551
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,185
Um, they've got to be
figuring that we've talked,

552
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,088
so you need to tell Mike

553
00:29:54,122 --> 00:29:56,925
that you are worried
about Hank's investigation.

554
00:29:56,959 --> 00:30:00,262
Okay? Hank already knows
who you are, by the way.

555
00:30:00,296 --> 00:30:04,166
And besides, you actually
did kill Gale,

556
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,534
so there's that.

557
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,469
This is all good fodder

558
00:30:07,503 --> 00:30:09,671
for you to request
a sit-down with Gus

559
00:30:09,706 --> 00:30:11,339
so you can discuss
what you would say

560
00:30:11,374 --> 00:30:13,542
in case Hank brings you
in for questioning.

561
00:30:13,577 --> 00:30:14,877
Okay? Now you just--

562
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,845
you just say
that you want to be--

563
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,647
no, that--
that you need

564
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:20,749
to be able to be
properly coached,

565
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:21,984
and when you're near him--

566
00:30:23,286 --> 00:30:24,787
you put this to use.

567
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,989
He's just going to tell me

568
00:30:27,023 --> 00:30:29,158
to shut my mouth if I get busted.

569
00:30:29,193 --> 00:30:30,927
He ain't going to set up
no meeting.

570
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:33,196
Well, then insist on it, damn it!

571
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,231
Act panicked.

572
00:30:35,265 --> 00:30:37,300
Gus' ass is on the line,

573
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:38,968
And trust me.
He will meet with you

574
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,436
if he thinks
that you're a liability.

575
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:44,707
No, he will waste me
if he thinks I'm a liability.

576
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:47,810
You know what? Whatever, man.

577
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:49,478
I'm going to take a piss.

578
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:41,396
Uh, I think you got a phone call.

579
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,537
Anything important?

580
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,367
Yes?

581
00:32:20,401 --> 00:32:21,635
<i>I did some digging around.</i>

582
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:22,836
And?

583
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:26,194
Neither the DEA nor the APD

584
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:28,096
considers you
a person of interest.

585
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:29,597
<i>Schrader's looking into you</i>

586
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:30,898
<i>totally on his lonesome.</i>

587
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:32,566
<i>A voice in the wilderness.</i>

588
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:34,468
Does he have resources?

589
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:36,002
<i>Just him, his credit card,</i>

590
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,571
<i>and his chauffeur Walter.</i>

591
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:40,341
From what I hear, he would be
committing career suicide

592
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,576
if he were to mention you
to Merkert again.

593
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,945
<i>So no warrant</i>

594
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:45,412
<i>for the tracking device</i>
<i>on my car.</i>

595
00:32:45,447 --> 00:32:47,982
No. The guy's gone
totally maverick.

596
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:50,051
He's Miss Daisy with binoculars.

597
00:32:50,085 --> 00:32:51,453
We watch our backs,

598
00:32:51,487 --> 00:32:53,121
make sure we don't
throw him any bones,

599
00:32:53,156 --> 00:32:54,690
he'll never make a case.

600
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,291
What about Chile?

601
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:58,926
<i>If I can't find any trace</i>
<i>of you before '89,</i>

602
00:32:58,961 --> 00:33:01,428
<i>I seriously doubt Schrader can.</i>

603
00:33:01,463 --> 00:33:04,498
Seems to me the bigger
problem's the cartel.

604
00:33:04,533 --> 00:33:08,402
We can handle them if that's
all we've got on our plate.

605
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:10,637
But dealing with both Schrader

606
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:13,807
and the Mexicans
at the same time,

607
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:18,246
if he happens to be watching
when they make a move,

608
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,115
<i>they could be the perfect storm.</i>

609
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:22,650
Thank you.

610
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:24,585
I'll be in touch.

611
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,171
Hello, Hector.

612
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:24,612
The cartel has given me
its ultimatum,

613
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:26,381
to which I've said no.

614
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,119
DEA agent Schrader--

615
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,321
uh, he's a concern.

616
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,360
He's looking into my past.

617
00:34:53,373 --> 00:34:56,176
Is today the day, Hector?

618
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:07,182
Si.

619
00:46:10,331 --> 00:46:11,733
Look at me, Hector.

620
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:23,142
Look... at... me.

621
00:46:45,026 --> 00:46:47,133
Maybe next time.

622
00:46:47,494 --> 00:46:55,968

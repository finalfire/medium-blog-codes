3
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:13,725
Don't report this.

4
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:15,459
I'll do it.
I'll kill him.

5
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,001
Stick this on the car and
see where it goes.

6
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:19,408
Do it.

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,330
If something were to
happen to Hank then

8
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:26,724
that would only draw
their attention to you.

9
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,641
I will make sure that
he discovers nothing.

You're like a bee

14
00:01:48,782 --> 00:01:50,683
Bzzz.
Good morning.

15
00:01:50,717 --> 00:01:52,417
Hey, buddy.

16
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:54,219
Ready to get your rocks on?

17
00:01:54,253 --> 00:01:55,420
See? I knew it.

18
00:01:55,455 --> 00:01:57,690
"Mineral show" is just
some sort of guy code

20
00:01:59,192 --> 00:02:00,827
Hey, you got any singles?

21
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:03,596
- Got it?
- Yeah.

22
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,964
Yeah.

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,935
Don't let him
get too crazy, okay?

24
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,204
Cram one more giant geode
in here,

25
00:02:12,238 --> 00:02:13,772
we'll be sleeping
in the garage.

26
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:14,773
Got it.
I got it.

27
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:15,807
I'm sorry.

28
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:23,748
Christ.

29
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:25,382
Longest week ever.

30
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:29,153
I just hope we get
something good, you know?

31
00:02:29,187 --> 00:02:31,054
Keep your fingers crossed.

32
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:38,162
Relax, buddy.
This ain't no spy movie.

33
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,100
It's more like <i>Rocky,</i> you know?

Leaving.

42
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,303
No, you got to go inside

43
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,571
and order something
like last time

44
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:55,739
to avoid suspicion.

45
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:58,542
Besides,
I want a vanilla shake.

46
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:01,078
We'll use the drive-through.

47
00:04:08,454 --> 00:04:10,889
All right, baby.
Let's see what we got.

48
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:30,709
What the hell?

49
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:34,546
Look at this.
Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom.

50
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,316
That's work, that's home,
that's work, that's home.

51
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,720
What, this guy goes
two places every day all week?

52
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:45,422
It's unbelievable.

53
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,957
Chicken-slinging
son of a bitch.

54
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:52,695
Hank, is it possible that...

55
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:55,631
maybe, just maybe...

56
00:04:55,665 --> 00:04:57,700
he's not your guy?

57
00:04:57,734 --> 00:05:00,569
Oh, a guy this clean's
got to be dirty.

58
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,541
What's the play here, buddy?

59
00:05:05,575 --> 00:05:07,477
How do I get this guy?

60
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,347
Yeah.

61
00:05:10,381 --> 00:05:11,815
How?

62
00:06:12,744 --> 00:06:14,145
Yes, hi.

63
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:17,481
I live on the 4900 block
of Doswell Place,

64
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:20,584
and I want to report
a very suspicious man

65
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:22,553
who's lurking
in my neighborhood.

66
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,121
He's sitting in a blue Sedan,

67
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,624
and he-- He's been staring
at a particular house

68
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:27,991
for a very long time.

69
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,761
Thank you. Thank you so much.

70
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:33,464
If you would,
I would appreciate it.

71
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,997
All right.

72
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,132
So I guess we better
get started.

73
00:07:11,201 --> 00:07:12,401
I already did.

74
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:16,406
Yeah?

75
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey, uh...

76
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:28,520
You got one of those for me?

77
00:07:28,554 --> 00:07:29,921
One of those what?

78
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:30,955
Cigarette.

79
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,661
Like, it's still in there,
all right?

80
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:38,529
I didn't get a chance yet.

81
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:44,435
Just give me one.

82
00:08:04,088 --> 00:08:05,121
Hmm.

83
00:08:09,827 --> 00:08:12,129
So what have you been up to?

84
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:13,697
What?

85
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:16,799
You know, just
a day in the life.

86
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,534
What do you do after work?

87
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:23,773
Go home, watch TV.

88
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,308
What do you watch?

89
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,177
I don't know. Stuff.

90
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:28,712
Like what?

91
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,251

00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,358
What happens on that one?

95
00:08:40,393 --> 00:08:43,695
Guys drive on ice.

96
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,003
I am going to do it.

97
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,411
You got to inhale, by the way.

98
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:06,716
What the hell, man, don't you
have enough cancer already?

99
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:12,154
Look, I said...I'd do it.

100
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:13,823
I'll do it.

101
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:19,595
Yeah, well,
what does it matter?

102
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,864
We're both dead men anyway.

103
00:09:56,902 --> 00:09:57,935
<i>Hi.</i>

104
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,203
Hi.

105
00:09:59,238 --> 00:10:01,939
Am I, uh, catching you
at a bad time?

106
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:04,508
No, I have a few minutes.

107
00:10:04,542 --> 00:10:07,510
So Mr. I'm Almost 16
So Leave Me Alone

108
00:10:07,545 --> 00:10:09,179
doesn't want a big thing
for his birthday.

109
00:10:09,213 --> 00:10:11,048
He just wants to hang out
with his friends,

110
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,550
which is fine by me. You?

111
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:13,918
Fine by me.

112
00:10:13,953 --> 00:10:16,855
<i>Okay. So I figured, uh,</i>

113
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,124
<i>low-key family dinner,</i>
<i>no official party,</i>

114
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,028
<i>and we bite the bullet</i> <i>and...</i>

115
00:10:23,464 --> 00:10:24,797
buy him a car--

116
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:28,268
Uh, used, I was thinking,
would be best.

117
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:30,137
But no more
than five years old.

118
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,440
Air bags, safety rated,
all that.

119
00:10:33,475 --> 00:10:35,676
Do you, um, have any thoughts

120
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,144
on what kind,

121
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,047
or should I
just go ahead and--

122
00:10:40,081 --> 00:10:42,983
Yeah. No, you just go ahead.

123
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,151
<i>Okay.</i>

124
00:10:46,055 --> 00:10:48,589
<i>Listen. On another subject,</i>

125
00:10:48,624 --> 00:10:50,992
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i> <i>that</i>

126
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:53,327
business is good.

127
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,696
Really good.

128
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:59,900
So good that I'm thinking
maybe...

129
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:04,204
you don't even need
to work your second job.

130
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:12,246
You're turning a profit?

131
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,781
<i>We're coming close.</i>

132
00:11:13,815 --> 00:11:15,083
Give us another month or two,

133
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:19,754
and, uh, yeah, we'll be there.

134
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,490
All of this to say

135
00:11:22,524 --> 00:11:26,326
maybe you could start thinking
about an exit strategy.

136
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,399
I'm working on it.

137
00:11:34,136 --> 00:11:35,370
Okay.

138
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,920
Hello.

139
00:12:05,955 --> 00:12:07,622
<i>Hey, buddy. Wake you?</i>

140
00:12:10,392 --> 00:12:12,060
No, Hank, I'm up.

141
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:15,096
Oh, good. Uh, what you doing?

142
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,931
<i>I'm, uh...</i>

143
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,399
Hey, listen,
I-I'll cut to it.

144
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:19,834
I got another favor to ask.

145
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,335
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about this Gus Fring, right?</i>

146
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,104
<i>How he never goes anywhere,</i>

147
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,672
<i>one restaurant, home,</i>
<i>one restaurant, home,</i>

148
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:25,907
<i>back and forth</i> <i>back and forth?</i>

149
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:27,108
<i>Which, now I'm even</i>
<i>more convinced</i>

150
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,710
<i>is bullshit, because</i>
<i>the man owns</i>

151
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,745
<i>13 other restaurants, right?</i>

152
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,781
So I started thinking about this
little empire of his, right?

153
00:12:33,816 --> 00:12:35,416
Fourteen restaurants.
Who supplies them?

154
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:37,885
What's the base of operations?

155
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,288
So I do a little diggin',
and bingo!

156
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:43,157
Pollos Hermanos has
a main distribution center.

157
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:44,692
<i>Uh... It's not far from town.</i>

158
00:12:44,727 --> 00:12:47,228
The place is huge.
I mean--

159
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:48,896
I'm looking at it
online right now.

160
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,865
I tell you, it's
a big warehouse

161
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,435
and rows of these
long poultry buildings,

162
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,471
or hatcheries, or
whatever you call 'em.

163
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:59,307
<i>Lots of space to hide</i>
<i>illicit activity.</i>

164
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,143
<i>Sounds promising, right?</i>

165
00:13:02,177 --> 00:13:03,511
Huh.

166
00:13:03,545 --> 00:13:05,513
<i>So. Whaddya say, buddy?</i>

167
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:08,683
<i>Got another</i> <i>field trip in you?</i>

168
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:09,750
Uhh...

169
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,921
You know, Hank. Um...

170
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,622
I mean, it sounds great.

171
00:13:15,656 --> 00:13:18,190
It really does. But I--

172
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:20,893
You know, I won't lie, uh--

173
00:13:20,927 --> 00:13:25,497
You caught me...
somewhat...

174
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,832
indisposed.

175
00:13:27,867 --> 00:13:29,901
What do you mean, like
taking a dump indisposed?

176
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,005
Yeah. That's--

177
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,541
Embarrassingly, that's it.

178
00:13:36,576 --> 00:13:39,911
You know, it's just...

179
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,479
upset stomach, you know,
and everything...

180
00:13:41,514 --> 00:13:44,650
- Yeah.
<i>- It's out of control.</i>

181
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:46,952
Really explosive.

182
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:49,020
Bad Tex-Mex.

183
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:50,956
- At the mall.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

184
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:53,992
I get it. You don't have
to paint me a picture.

185
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:55,961
Probably one guy in a diaper
is enough for this trip anyway.

186
00:13:55,995 --> 00:13:57,796
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry, Hank.</i>

187
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,331
Hey, don't be.

188
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:00,799
I've been asking a lot
of you lately.

189
00:14:00,834 --> 00:14:02,368
I appreciate it.

190
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:05,504
I'll find another
ride for this one.

191
00:14:05,538 --> 00:14:09,374
Another ride?

192
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:11,543
Yeah. I'm sure I can get
someone else to take me.

193
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,377
Uh, my trainer, Chuck.

194
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:14,912
Maybe I'll ask him.

195
00:14:14,946 --> 00:14:16,514
<i>Look, I'm-- I'm--</i>

196
00:14:16,548 --> 00:14:19,049
<i>This is probably</i>
<i>just a 24-hour thing.</i>

197
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:21,351
Maybe 48 hours, at the most.

198
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:22,986
And, um...

199
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:25,488
Do you think you could
possibly hold off

200
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:27,289
for a day or two?

201
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,161
Aw, jeez, buddy.
I mean, I-- You know--

202
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:32,729
<i>You know, I just--</i>

203
00:14:32,763 --> 00:14:34,164
<i>I would just really...</i>

204
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,801
love to be the one
to be able to--

205
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,703
to take you there, and--

206
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:43,408
I mean, I have just
really enjoyed, you know,

207
00:14:43,443 --> 00:14:45,411
the time with you,

208
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:48,648
- and helping you.
<i>- Well, yeah.</i>

209
00:14:48,682 --> 00:14:51,150
Okay, sure. If it means
that much to you.

210
00:14:52,353 --> 00:14:53,986
Just, you know, give me a call

211
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:55,654
when you're feeling
up to it, all right?

212
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,357
Thank you.
I will. Okay.

213
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:00,892
Bye.

214
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:24,284
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Uh, Mike.

215
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:27,221
Listen. I just want to say,
first off,

216
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:28,989
don't be angry.

217
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,123
<i>What is it, Walter?</i>

218
00:15:30,158 --> 00:15:31,592
My brother-in-law,

219
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:34,828
My DEA-- He--

220
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:37,297
Soon, he will probably,

221
00:15:37,332 --> 00:15:40,167
in the near future,
take a ride out to

222
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,068
a certain distribution center,

223
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:45,538
to look around for things.

224
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:53,946
Look around for things.
And... Yeah.

225
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:57,316
Uh.

226
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:00,053
Mike?

227
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:21,308
- Where's this all going?
- Elsewhere.

228
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:32,419
You're all set.

229
00:16:32,453 --> 00:16:35,422
Thank you. Please give this
to your car care professional.

230
00:16:46,802 --> 00:16:49,503
So. A hand wax
for you today?

231
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:52,372
Okay. Great.

232
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:58,812
Please give this to your
car care professional.

233
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:00,279
And the black Explorer?

234
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:02,615
Well, of course we could shampoo
your floor mats, but really,

235
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:04,883
deluxe detailing is
the best bang for your buck.

236
00:17:04,918 --> 00:17:07,320
Oh, and SUVs are extra.

237
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:11,391
And please give this to
your car care professional.

238
00:17:11,425 --> 00:17:12,725
Thank you!

239
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,795
Please give this to
your car care professional.

240
00:17:21,203 --> 00:17:22,236
Hey, Sky.

241
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:25,506
Oh, my God.
Ted.

242
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,108
What are you, uh--

243
00:17:27,142 --> 00:17:28,910
Someone from the office, uh,

244
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:31,279
said you worked down here,
so I thought I'd...

245
00:17:31,313 --> 00:17:32,880
come down and say hi.

246
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:34,181
Wow. Well, uh...

247
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:37,083
Hello.

248
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:38,484
You look great.

249
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,887
No. I'm gonna like--

250
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,421
I probably just look crazed.

251
00:17:42,456 --> 00:17:45,190
Not at all.
You look happy.

252
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,959
Last time I saw you--

253
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,332
Hi, there.

254
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:55,834
Uh, thing is,

255
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,869
Skyler, um,

256
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,904
I really need to talk to you.

257
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,009
Ted,

258
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:08,113
I really don't think we have
anything to talk about.

259
00:18:09,582 --> 00:18:12,017
Actually, we do.

260
00:18:12,051 --> 00:18:13,952
An audit?

261
00:18:13,986 --> 00:18:18,624
Wait, an audit tomorrow?

262
00:18:18,658 --> 00:18:20,860
How long have you had this?

263
00:18:20,894 --> 00:18:23,462
Awhile. I'd...

264
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:25,598
debated, you know,
contacting you.

265
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,900
Contact me? What about
a lawyer? Ted--

266
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:30,603
Ted, this is--

267
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:32,105
This is the CID.

268
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:35,407
The Criminal Division.

269
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:39,378
My God, you facing
a felony charge here.

270
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:42,115
$100,000 fine
on top of the taxes

271
00:18:42,149 --> 00:18:43,783
you already owe, plus

272
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:45,452
five years in prison!

273
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,420
Yeah. It's bad.

274
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:50,390
Yeah.
It most certainly is.

275
00:18:51,926 --> 00:18:53,260
Look, here's the thing.

276
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:56,998
I was wondering, maybe, if um,

277
00:18:57,032 --> 00:18:58,666
there's some way
you could help with this.

278
00:18:58,701 --> 00:19:02,938
Help? Help how?

279
00:19:02,973 --> 00:19:06,276
Well, with your knowledge
of how the books

280
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,445
got the way they are,
maybe there's some way

281
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:10,380
you could, uh,

282
00:19:10,414 --> 00:19:12,815
undo what's in there.

283
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,119
You want me to
uncook your books?

284
00:19:16,153 --> 00:19:18,954
Maybe there's some method,
or some accounting trick

285
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,657
- you could, you know, use--
- Ted.

286
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:23,626
It doesn't work like that.

287
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,095
The damage is already--

288
00:19:29,933 --> 00:19:34,503
My name. My signatures

289
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:37,705
are all over those books.

290
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,141
Skyler, I'm accountable,
not you.

291
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,910
Let me explain what's
gonna happen here, okay?

292
00:19:42,944 --> 00:19:46,480
Once the CID sees this
as willful tax fraud,

293
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,582
there are going to build
the strongest possible case

294
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:51,151
against you, and once
they start down that path,

295
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:53,887
they have an 80%
conviction rate.

296
00:19:53,922 --> 00:19:57,257
That's because they're allowed
to monitor your mail,

297
00:19:57,292 --> 00:20:01,528
and tap your phones--
and not just you, Ted.

298
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:04,698
Everyone involved
in those books.

299
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:10,704
I can't have this in my life.

300
00:20:10,738 --> 00:20:13,340
I cannot be audited.

301
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:14,641
Skyler, you-- you--

302
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:17,276
You're going to be fine, okay?
They're after me.

303
00:20:17,311 --> 00:20:20,546
It's the captain they want,
not some cashier at a car wash.

304
00:20:23,883 --> 00:20:26,151
No offense. I'm sorry.

305
00:20:26,185 --> 00:20:29,554
I, uh,

306
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:31,857
I don't want you
to worry, okay?

307
00:20:32,993 --> 00:20:35,561
I'm gonna figure out
a way through this.

308
00:20:35,596 --> 00:20:37,530
Somehow. Okay?

309
00:20:47,776 --> 00:20:49,577
Here.

310
00:20:49,612 --> 00:20:51,178
Right here.

311
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,229
So is he gonna kill him?

312
00:21:13,468 --> 00:21:14,868
Is who gonna kill who?

313
00:21:17,372 --> 00:21:19,206
Gus.

314
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,775
Is he gonna kill
Mr. White's brother-in-law?

315
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,316
I mean, he's the reason
for all this here, right?

316
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:35,923
Because it's totally logical
for him to off the dude.

317
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,028
A-hole DEA agent,

318
00:21:41,063 --> 00:21:42,997
pokin' around your junk--

319
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,901
Who needs that, right?

320
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:52,006
Makes sense
to get rid of him...

321
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,676
for good.

322
00:21:58,948 --> 00:22:02,551
But killing a cop--

323
00:22:02,585 --> 00:22:05,920
I don't know.

324
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,490
It could look suspicious
if, uh,

325
00:22:08,524 --> 00:22:10,859
the dude who's
investigating you

326
00:22:10,893 --> 00:22:12,928
suddenly up and dies.

327
00:22:18,201 --> 00:22:20,870
Then there's--
There's Mr. White.

328
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,308
Who'd be even more ape shit

329
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:30,246
if he had family
getting murdered.

330
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:36,185
He'd never cook for Gus again.

331
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:46,460
Guess there's a lot
of angles to consider.

332
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:52,532
If something were
to happen to the man,

333
00:22:52,567 --> 00:22:54,601
would you have
a problem with that?

334
00:23:00,441 --> 00:23:02,442
Who really cares what I think?

335
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:59,833
Son of a bitch!

336
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:04,403
You get comfortable, kid.
We may be here a while.

337
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,855
- Hey.
- Get down!

338
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:20,668
<i>Sí.</i>

339
00:26:05,501 --> 00:26:08,186
- Should I even ask?
- I wouldn't.

340
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:19,293
So what? Is this going
to be a regular thing now?

341
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,796
Meth cooking
and corpse disposal? Jesus.

342
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,633
Just grab us
a spare barrel, Walter.

343
00:26:27,137 --> 00:26:28,336
What was it this time?

344
00:26:28,371 --> 00:26:31,740
What did this poor bastard do
to piss off Gus?

345
00:26:31,774 --> 00:26:33,809
Or did Gus just need
to send another message?

346
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:36,178
Shut your mouth.

347
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:38,880
You shut your mouth,
or I'll shut it for you.

348
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:40,782
I don't want you talking
to me or Jesse.

349
00:26:40,816 --> 00:26:42,717
Just get the barrel.

350
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,287
And if you ever plan
on calling the cops

351
00:26:46,321 --> 00:26:49,523
on one of my guys again,

352
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,192
you go ahead
and get two barrels.

353
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:32,333
Yo, like, uh,

354
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:35,770
I guess I never thanked you for

355
00:27:35,804 --> 00:27:37,338
what you did.

356
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,609
Thanks.

357
00:27:44,013 --> 00:27:46,281
Next time, don't stand there
like an idiot.

358
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,385
Move your feet,
run and so forth.

359
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,655
But seriously,
what--

360
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:54,022
What was the deal with Gus?

361
00:27:54,057 --> 00:27:57,459
- The deal?
- The Terminator shit?

362
00:27:57,493 --> 00:27:59,460
Walking right into the bullets?

363
00:27:59,494 --> 00:28:02,329
What the hell was he doing?

364
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:04,898
The cartel needs Gus.

365
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,466
His distribution network.

366
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:08,168
They're not looking
to kill him.

367
00:28:08,202 --> 00:28:11,771
But what? The rest of us
are like, open season?

368
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:13,339
Is he doing anything
about that?

369
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:14,641
Or do we just keep hanging out

370
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:15,975
for target practice
while he's--

371
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,710
Kid.

372
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:21,281
Enough. You got questions,

373
00:28:21,315 --> 00:28:22,582
ask him yourself.

374
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,401
And here again.
Unreported income.

375
00:28:39,436 --> 00:28:43,273
That's more than
a year straight so far.

376
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:44,808
Do you want to say
something about this?

377
00:28:44,842 --> 00:28:47,778
Because I'm having
a hard time figuring it out.

378
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:51,849
Well, I-- I'd have to, um,

379
00:28:51,883 --> 00:28:53,951
have a look at the copies
of the receipts

380
00:28:53,985 --> 00:28:55,552
to refresh my memory.

381
00:28:55,586 --> 00:28:57,420
Take all the time
you need, Mr. Beneke.

382
00:28:57,454 --> 00:28:59,522
That's why we're here.

383
00:29:03,193 --> 00:29:07,162
Oh, I am so sorry I am late.

384
00:29:07,196 --> 00:29:08,696
I got lost.

385
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:10,865
- Hey, Ted.
- Sky.

386
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,000
Whoo!

387
00:29:12,034 --> 00:29:14,369
This building is so confusing.

388
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:15,770
There are doors everywhere.

389
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:17,506
Hi. You are--

390
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,340
Special Agent James Bekaris.

391
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,143
Ooh. Special.

392
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:23,345
Skyler White.

393
00:29:23,379 --> 00:29:26,215
Ms. White. You are
the accountant

394
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:27,917
of record for many
of these reports.

395
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:29,519
- Is that correct?
- Guilty as charged.

396
00:29:29,553 --> 00:29:31,487
Well then, perhaps you can
shed some light

397
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:33,356
on this history
of missing revenue.

398
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:35,125
Missing?
Uh-huh.

399
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,161
- No, it's there.
- No.

400
00:29:37,195 --> 00:29:39,764
Revenue most definitely
flowed through this company.

401
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:42,000
But it's not all accounted for
in your reports.

402
00:29:42,034 --> 00:29:44,570
Huh!

403
00:29:47,507 --> 00:29:50,243
Hmm, let's take a look.

404
00:29:50,277 --> 00:29:51,877
Hmm. Oh.

405
00:29:51,912 --> 00:29:54,579
Well, you know,
this account here?

406
00:29:54,614 --> 00:29:56,648
That is Mr. Keller's account,

407
00:29:56,682 --> 00:29:59,484
and Mr. Keller's
an old friend of Ted's dad,

408
00:29:59,518 --> 00:30:02,086
and he always sends
an electronic payment,

409
00:30:02,121 --> 00:30:03,221
which personally I hate,

410
00:30:03,255 --> 00:30:04,923
because
I'm a real paper person,

411
00:30:04,957 --> 00:30:07,725
but Mr. Keller's one
of those environmental people.

412
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,060
So anyway, since there
wasn't a physical check,

413
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:12,830
I didn't enter it
into the book, but...

414
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:14,965
the money's there.

415
00:30:16,368 --> 00:30:19,404
Ms. White, you've read
Section 61 of the IRC?

416
00:30:19,438 --> 00:30:22,573
I... did not follow
what you just said.

417
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:26,678
How gross income for a
business is defined.

418
00:30:26,712 --> 00:30:28,714
- You're not allowed to do that.
- Well, I think I am.

419
00:30:28,748 --> 00:30:30,315
No, you're not.

420
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,418
Well, you know what they say
about opinions, right?

421
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:35,387
Everyone's got one.

422
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:38,057
But seriously, I am.

423
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:39,959
Look, it doesn't matter
if its an electronic check

424
00:30:39,993 --> 00:30:42,328
or a paper check,
income is income.

425
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:44,464
You're not allowed
to not declare it.

426
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:47,868
When I input everything
into the Quicken,

427
00:30:47,902 --> 00:30:50,337
nothing flashed red,
so that's gotta mean

428
00:30:50,371 --> 00:30:53,306
it's okay, right?

429
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,408
Quicken.
Uh-huh.

430
00:30:55,442 --> 00:30:58,143
You used Quicken
to manage books

431
00:30:58,178 --> 00:30:59,811
for a business this size.

432
00:30:59,846 --> 00:31:01,813
I did. Oh, do you guys
use that here?

433
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:03,414
'Cause it is the best.

434
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:06,651
It's like having a calculator
on your computer. Amazing.

435
00:31:06,685 --> 00:31:08,619
Ms. White, how did you
get this job?

436
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:10,488
- Oh, Ted hired me.
- No.

437
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:13,024
I mean your qualifications.

438
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:14,259
What are your qualifications?

439
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:15,894
Where did you
get your training?

440
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:19,265
Ooh, well I haven't had
any training per se,

441
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:21,834
I've always been naturally
good with numbers.

442
00:31:21,869 --> 00:31:23,736
Got a good instinct for them.

443
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,572
Right, Teddy?

444
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:30,978
Right.

445
00:31:31,012 --> 00:31:34,848
This is all falling
into place now.

446
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,320
Ms. White,
I just have to ask.

447
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:44,590
You're not managing accounts
anywhere else, are you?

448
00:31:44,625 --> 00:31:46,659
Right now? No.

449
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:48,727
I'm a cashier at a car wash.

450
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,734
I'm not really clear about
what happened in there.

451
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:57,171
What happened is good news.

452
00:31:57,205 --> 00:31:59,574
Ignorance of the law does
not equate to criminality.

453
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:01,543
It equates to ignorance.

454
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:04,646
Look, pay your back taxes,
pay the penalties,

455
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,915
and move on from this.
Just put it behind you.

456
00:32:06,949 --> 00:32:09,151
Pay with what?

457
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:11,286
I owe them $617,000.

458
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,054
- What am I--
- Look, just figure it out.

459
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:16,291
All right? You just
dodged prison.

460
00:32:16,325 --> 00:32:18,959
Sell your assets.
Get rid of the BMW,

461
00:32:18,994 --> 00:32:20,461
take out a second
mortgage on your house.

462
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:22,329
Take a mortgage?
I have a lien on my house.

463
00:32:22,363 --> 00:32:24,597
I don't have any assets.
There are no assets

464
00:32:24,631 --> 00:32:26,632
- left to sell.
- Ted.

465
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:29,868
If you don't pay them, they
will reopen the investigation.

466
00:32:29,903 --> 00:32:32,605
And that little fiction
I just spun up there

467
00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:34,707
will completely unravel.

468
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,842
You have to settle.

469
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:41,213
Wish I could.

470
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:30,863
Come in.

471
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:48,014
I hope you brought an appetite.

472
00:33:50,417 --> 00:33:52,218
Yeah. I guess.

473
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:58,825
Mike mentioned
you have some questions.

474
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:05,465
Yeah.

475
00:34:05,499 --> 00:34:09,136
We'll eat first.
And then we'll talk.

476
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,677
Right on.

477
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:31,391
What am I doing here?

478
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:44,803
I know you have concerns.

479
00:34:44,838 --> 00:34:47,706
What happened yesterday

480
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,441
to my man at the farm--

481
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:51,110
It was a terrible thing.

482
00:34:51,144 --> 00:34:55,148
Oh, the dude getting
his head blown off? Yeah.

483
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:58,853
I have invited you
into my home,

484
00:34:58,887 --> 00:35:00,988
prepared food,

485
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:03,725
so we could sit and talk.

486
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:09,698
Discuss what's going on
in this business,

487
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,768
our business, like men.

488
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:16,504
And I will explain
everything that's happening.

489
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,673
I will answer your questions.

490
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:23,344
But first, I need you...

491
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:26,580
to answer one question for me.

492
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,517
Can you cook Walter's formula?

493
00:35:32,887 --> 00:35:35,055
What?

494
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,824
Walter's formula.

495
00:35:36,858 --> 00:35:39,393
Can you produce this product?

496
00:35:39,427 --> 00:35:42,864
Without any help, alone?

497
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:45,099
No.

498
00:35:47,337 --> 00:35:48,870
Why?

499
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:53,442
You asking me if I can
cook Mr. White's crystal?

500
00:35:53,476 --> 00:35:58,314
Without him? Me?

501
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:00,316
The junkie loser
you were about to waste

502
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,751
and dump in the desert
a month ago?

503
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,621
This is your plan, huh?

504
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:11,027
Invite me in your house,
make whatever this is,

505
00:36:11,061 --> 00:36:15,665
be my buddy and--
And make me feel

506
00:36:15,699 --> 00:36:17,767
important,

507
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:21,704
then get me to keep
cooking for you

508
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:24,207
after you kill Mr. White.

509
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:29,079
You want to-- You want
to talk like men?

510
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,480
Let's talk like men!

511
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:34,718
You kill Mr. White, you're
gonna have to kill me too.

512
00:36:34,752 --> 00:36:37,954
That is not what I asked you.

513
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,457
You are here

514
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,393
because circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

515
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:45,662
And I need your help.

516
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:49,632
I need you to help prevent
an all-out war.

517
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:54,504
Now, if you would,

518
00:36:54,538 --> 00:36:56,906
answer the question.

519
00:37:57,284 --> 00:38:00,318
Hey, you, uh--
You headed out?

520
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,824
Yeah.

521
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,236
<i>Yo, Mr. White. Hey, uh,</i>

522
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,038
<i>I really got to talk to you.</i>
<i>I-- I don't know</i>

523
00:38:53,072 --> 00:38:54,839
<i>if you're with</i>
<i>your family or whatever,</i>

524
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:59,010
<i>but this is important,</i>
<i>so I'm hoping</i>

525
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,880
<i>you could come over.</i>

526
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:11,423
Thank God. Come on in.

527
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,595
You uh--
You want a beer?

528
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:18,797
- Or something?
- No.

529
00:39:18,831 --> 00:39:20,666
- Should I sit down?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

530
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,502
Yeah, sorry.
Go ahead.

531
00:39:23,536 --> 00:39:26,038
Okay, so, um--

532
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,706
Okay. So...

533
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,209
word has come
down that they--

534
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:34,246
They want me to go to Mexico.

535
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,516
There's some sort
of war brewing

536
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,085
between Gus and the cartel.

537
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,554
"Word has come down?"

538
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:45,558
Yeah, the cartel has been
messing with Gus's operation.

539
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,626
Like jacking trucks
to like, send a message,

540
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,029
and you know, yesterday,
that dude

541
00:39:50,063 --> 00:39:51,430
we brought to the lab?

542
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:54,033
I mean, they shot him
right in front of me.

543
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,402
Just blew his head open.

544
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:59,072
Some sniper nailed him
from like a mile away.

545
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:04,143
Anyway, they've been
holding them off,

546
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:07,546
but between the cartel
taking pot shots

547
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:09,815
and your brother-in-law
trying to throw a net

548
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:12,350
over the whole deal, it's
like, what do you call,

549
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:15,086
a rock and a hard place
situation.

550
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:19,524
So Gus is gonna cave.

551
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:21,960
So the cartel wants half

552
00:40:21,994 --> 00:40:24,529
of Gus' entire operation,
and they want

553
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:27,432
your formula, and he's
gonna give it to them.

554
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,767
Well, I-- I gotta
give it to them.

555
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,969
I mean, I'm supposed
to go to Mexico

556
00:40:32,004 --> 00:40:34,806
and teach a bunch of
cartel chemists

557
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,841
how to cook a batch of blue.

558
00:40:38,343 --> 00:40:40,478
You know, Gus doesn't
trust you, so...

559
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:43,748
I gotta go-- I mean,
you're the chemist, man!

560
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:45,349
You know, not me.

561
00:40:45,383 --> 00:40:46,817
Let's say I go down

562
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:50,019
to, you know, go over there,
go to the jungle

563
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:51,654
or-- Or whatever.

564
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:54,090
You know, and say they got,
like, actual chemists,

565
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:57,860
like cartel chemists,
asking me chemistry stuff

566
00:40:57,894 --> 00:41:00,529
that I don't know how to
answer because I'm not you?

567
00:41:00,564 --> 00:41:02,265
And what if, like,
all the equipment

568
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:05,969
is uh, is in Mexican,
instead of English?

569
00:41:06,004 --> 00:41:08,305
You know? Oh!

570
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,241
I don't know.
I don't know.

571
00:41:10,275 --> 00:41:13,378
I mean, if I mess this up,

572
00:41:13,412 --> 00:41:15,513
I am dead, you know?

573
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,649
All of us!

574
00:41:20,086 --> 00:41:24,022
So I-- Look, I--
I need your help.

575
00:41:24,056 --> 00:41:26,090
Okay, maybe you could--

576
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,526
Maybe you could, like, coach me

577
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,694
or something, you know?

578
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:33,063
Or you can give me some notes.

579
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:36,366
Mr. White.

580
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,201
So you saw Gus?

581
00:41:39,803 --> 00:41:41,738
What? No.

582
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:45,042
You didn't see Gus.
No.

583
00:41:45,076 --> 00:41:48,413
Then who told you all of that?

584
00:41:48,447 --> 00:41:51,449
It was passed down,
like I said.

585
00:41:51,484 --> 00:41:54,786
Passed down?

586
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,455
By whom?

587
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,824
By, uh...
By Mike and them.

588
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:00,025
They did. They--

589
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,827
So "they" doesn't include Gus.

590
00:42:02,861 --> 00:42:04,862
You haven't been with Gus.

591
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,698
You haven't seen Gus.
You haven't spoken to Gus.

592
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:08,833
Why are you...

593
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:11,268
You weren't at Gus's house
last night.

594
00:42:11,303 --> 00:42:13,371
What?

595
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,108
What the hell?

596
00:42:17,142 --> 00:42:19,610
J-Jesus--

597
00:42:19,644 --> 00:42:20,811
It's still here.

598
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,082
- It's still here.
- Oh, Jesus.

599
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,958
You look me in the eye
and you tell me

600
00:42:32,992 --> 00:42:35,594
that you weren't at
his house last night.

601
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:39,799
I, um...

602
00:42:39,833 --> 00:42:41,534
Look, I didn't have a chance.

603
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:43,603
All right?

604
00:42:43,637 --> 00:42:45,940
Okay, I knew you would
react this way.

605
00:42:45,974 --> 00:42:47,808
I knew you would freak out

606
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:49,010
and wouldn't
believe me--

607
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:52,581
That's why I didn't
say anything.

608
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:55,817
Look, there was just this
one big pot of stew, okay?

609
00:42:55,852 --> 00:42:57,486
He just made this one big pot,

610
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,021
and we both ate from it--
What was I supposed to do?

611
00:43:00,055 --> 00:43:01,155
Huh? Poison myself?

612
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:03,424
Two hours and 18 minutes,

613
00:43:03,458 --> 00:43:05,559
and you couldn't figure out
a way to give it to him.

614
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:07,795
- He never left the room!
- You lying little shit!

615
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:10,731
You had one thing to do!

616
00:43:10,765 --> 00:43:13,599
One thing! That is
the only thing, I might add,

617
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:15,901
that would save our lives.

618
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:18,704
Right there.
You were in his house!

619
00:43:18,738 --> 00:43:20,706
And you didn't have
the guts to do it.

620
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:28,314
Two hours and 18 minutes?

621
00:43:28,348 --> 00:43:30,683
You never had any intention
of killing him, did you?

622
00:43:31,785 --> 00:43:34,854
How did you know I was
at his house last night?

623
00:43:34,888 --> 00:43:36,189
Were you following me?

624
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:43,128
This.
This is how I knew.

625
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:49,234
You bugged my car?

626
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:51,670
7:10 to 9:28 p.m.

627
00:43:51,704 --> 00:43:53,438
Two hours and 18 minutes,

628
00:43:53,473 --> 00:43:55,574
but you had no intentions,
did you?

629
00:43:55,608 --> 00:43:58,911
Not the slightest intention.

630
00:43:58,945 --> 00:44:00,880
Everything that
I have done for you--

631
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:04,183
You put a bug on my car?

632
00:44:04,217 --> 00:44:07,254
I'm sorry. After everything
you've done for me?

633
00:44:07,288 --> 00:44:09,523
What you've done for me?

634
00:44:09,557 --> 00:44:11,592
You've killed me
is what you've done.

635
00:44:11,626 --> 00:44:13,427
You've signed my death warrant.

636
00:44:13,462 --> 00:44:15,229
And now you want advice?

637
00:44:15,264 --> 00:44:16,397
All right,
I'll give you advice.

638
00:44:16,432 --> 00:44:19,333
Go to Mexico and screw up,
like I know you will,

639
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,202
and wind up
in a barrel somewhere!

640
00:45:12,155 --> 00:45:13,556
Oh, God!

641
00:46:14,189 --> 00:46:16,457
Can you walk?

642
00:46:19,161 --> 00:46:20,728
Yeah.

643
00:46:20,763 --> 00:46:24,532
You get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

644
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:40,012
Ohh!

645
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,500

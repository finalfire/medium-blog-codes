00:00:00,629 --> 00:00:03,770
Previously, on AMC's Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:10,366 --> 00:00:13,870
My signatures are all over those boxes.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,703
I cannot be audited.

4
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:18,080
Circumstances
with the cartel are untenable.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,621
And I need your help.

6
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:21,828
No one needs to go to Mexico.

7
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:23,999
The cartel wants your formula.

8
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,663
Now get the fuck out of here
and never come back.

10
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,501
You can do this.

11
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:55,716
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

12
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,846
<i>At the tone please state</i>
<i>your name, number,</i>

13
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,199
<i>and the reason for your call.</i>

14
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:01,402
<i>Thank you.</i>

15
00:03:01,437 --> 00:03:02,737
<i>Third try.</i>

16
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:04,773
<i>Walt, if you're there,</i>
<i>please pick up.</i>

17
00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:09,244
<i>Okay. Well, I really wanted</i>
<i>to do this together,</i>

18
00:03:09,278 --> 00:03:11,246
<i>but I can hear him getting up,</i>

19
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,081
<i>and it's not like I can keep</i>
<i>him from seeing the thing,</i>

20
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:16,251
<i>so I'm sorry, but I've waited</i>
<i>as long as possible,</i>

21
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:20,442
and I-- I guess I'm going to have
to go ahead without you,

22
00:03:20,562 --> 00:03:23,626
so call me.

23
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:32,436
Oh. Hey, happy birthday,
sweet sixteen.

24
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,905
Mwah.

25
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,206
Thanks, Mom.

26
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,308
Of course, I thought
you might sleep through it.

27
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,010
Ha ha.

28
00:03:39,045 --> 00:03:42,848
So since it's almost--
oh, noon,

29
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:45,250
I think your first
big birthday decision

30
00:03:45,284 --> 00:03:48,086
is breakfast or lunch.

31
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:49,688
Um, pancakes?

32
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:52,223
Pancakes it is.

33
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,292
Okay, could you do me a favor?

34
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:55,360
I forgot to get the paper.

35
00:03:55,394 --> 00:03:56,528
Can you go out
and grab it for me?

36
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,730
Sure.
Thanks.

37
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:13,447
Surprise!

38
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,051
It's from me and your dad.

39
00:04:17,085 --> 00:04:18,687
It's pretty slick, huh?

40
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:21,823
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.

41
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:24,358
It's-- It's great.

42
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,028
You know, I really did
a lot of research,

43
00:04:28,063 --> 00:04:29,597
and, I don't know,

44
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,165
this car just really
stood out to me.

45
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,668
It's got a ton
of great features--

46
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,703
power everything, solid engine,

47
00:04:35,737 --> 00:04:36,971
It's really roomy,

48
00:04:37,005 --> 00:04:39,940
so you can carpool
with all your friends,

49
00:04:39,975 --> 00:04:41,575
and of course it is safe

50
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:43,310
because I am still your mother.

51
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:45,512
Oh, and it has a CD player,

52
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:47,414
so you can listen to some tunes
while you're cruising around,

53
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:48,716
so you know what?

54
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,418
Breakfast can wait.

55
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:52,687
You want to take it for a spin?

56
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:55,123
Um, m-m-maybe later.

57
00:04:55,157 --> 00:04:57,158
I'm kind of starving.

58
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:59,161
Yeah, okay.
Well, let's--

59
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:02,197
let's get those pancakes going.

60
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:09,304
<i>Saul? He's here.</i>

61
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,073
Bad idea.

62
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,508
This is a bad idea.

63
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:14,876
<i>Saul.</i>

64
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:18,447
Send him in.

65
00:05:21,484 --> 00:05:24,687
Mr. Beneke. Saul Goodman.
Thank you for coming down.

66
00:05:26,756 --> 00:05:28,924
Yeah. Hi.

67
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:30,292
Have a seat, please.

68
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:33,829
I--

69
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:35,631
I don't really understand
why I'm here.

70
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:37,266
Is it something to do
with my creditors?

71
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,268
Creditors? No.

72
00:05:40,303 --> 00:05:41,970
I'll cut right to the chase.

73
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:44,373
Mr. Beneke,
I have some bad news.

74
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:46,042
Uh...

75
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:47,510
nothing but, lately.

76
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:49,912
Your great-aunt Birgit
passed away.

77
00:05:50,914 --> 00:05:52,081
I'm sorry, who?

78
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:53,815
Uh...

79
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,017
Apparently, she passed away

80
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,252
in Diekirch, Luxembourg,

81
00:05:57,286 --> 00:05:59,821
and this was, wow,
eight years ago.

82
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,589
I just assumed
you two were close,

83
00:06:01,623 --> 00:06:02,790
given that--

84
00:06:03,892 --> 00:06:06,560
Well, maybe this is good news.

85
00:06:07,662 --> 00:06:09,697
Birgit left behind
a sizable estate,

86
00:06:09,731 --> 00:06:13,133
of which you, Mr. Beneke,
are the primary beneficiary.

87
00:06:13,168 --> 00:06:16,670
- What? - Yeah, well, seems she had
no immediate relatives,

88
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:18,605
so the estate's
just been sitting

89
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,973
while the folks over in the EU

90
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,175
searched for a living heir.

91
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:28,082
I don't know of any relatives
in Luxembourg,

92
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:30,118
definitely no one who
would name me in their will.

93
00:06:30,153 --> 00:06:31,353
Huh.

94
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,624
Well...

95
00:06:36,594 --> 00:06:37,928
Ah, here you go.

96
00:06:37,963 --> 00:06:39,463
She left no will,

97
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,933
so that's probably
why it took so long.

98
00:06:41,967 --> 00:06:44,001
They traced the inheritance
through to your father,

99
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,203
but his having passed--

100
00:06:45,237 --> 00:06:46,371
my condolences--

101
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,473
you are the next in line

102
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:54,581
to the tune
of $621,552.33.

103
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,121
Wow.

104
00:09:03,448 --> 00:09:05,249
Where's the phenylacetic acid?

105
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:18,429
They synthesize their own.

106
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:21,365
What?

107
00:09:23,135 --> 00:09:24,869
I don't-- I don't do that.

108
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:30,709
Look, I get
my phenylacetic acid

109
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,244
from the barrel
with the bee on it.

110
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,347
That's how I know how to do it.

111
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:53,299
What is he saying?

112
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,468
We're working it out.

113
00:10:02,076 --> 00:10:06,880
Tell this asshole if he wants to
learn how to make my product,

114
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:10,083
he's got to do it my way,
the right way.

115
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,691
I speak English.

116
00:10:17,725 --> 00:10:21,061
So you understand
what asshole means.

117
00:10:21,095 --> 00:10:24,997
Now, go get me my
phenylacetic acid, asshole.

118
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:29,335
How long is it going to take you
to get him what he needs?

119
00:10:29,369 --> 00:10:31,638
I don't know.
I have no idea.

120
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,107
Several hours at least.
I can wait.

121
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,377
Gives us time to talk
about the state of this lab.

122
00:10:37,411 --> 00:10:39,212
Don't you have standards?

123
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,215
I mean, this place
is disgusting.

124
00:10:43,249 --> 00:10:46,050
All right, we're going to scour
every vat, every tank,

125
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,018
every cook surface,

126
00:10:48,053 --> 00:10:51,154
and then we're going to clean up every
possible source of contamination,

127
00:10:51,188 --> 00:10:55,057
and only then we cook.

128
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,492
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

129
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:01,897
Who do you think you are?

130
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:06,902
I'm the guy
your boss brought here

131
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:08,804
to show you how it's done,

132
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:12,274
and if this is how you run
your lab, no wonder.

133
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:15,144
You're lucky
he hasn't fired your ass.

134
00:11:15,178 --> 00:11:17,480
Now, if you don't want
that to happen,

135
00:11:17,514 --> 00:11:20,449
I suggest you stop whining
like a little bitch

136
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:22,819
and do what I say.

137
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,987
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

138
00:12:43,022 --> 00:12:44,923
<i>At the tone please state</i>
<i>your name, number,</i>

139
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:46,191

140
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:47,826
<i>Thank you.</i>

141
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,895
<i>Dad! You there?</i>

142
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,330
<i>I'm outside.</i>

143
00:12:51,364 --> 00:12:52,965
<i>Are you okay?</i>

144
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,834
<i>I know you're home.</i>
<i>Your car is here.</i>

145
00:12:54,868 --> 00:12:56,269
<i>You missed my party,</i>

146
00:12:56,303 --> 00:12:58,705
<i>which feels like something's</i>
<i>gotta be really wrong.</i>

147
00:12:58,739 --> 00:13:01,975
<i>I'm... I'm gonna</i>
<i>have to call 911.</i>

148
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:03,877
<i>I don't know what else to do.</i>

149
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,790
Dad?

150
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,429
Come in if you're coming in.

151
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,271
What happened to you?

152
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,945
What happened?

153
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:46,819
I got into a fight.

154
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:47,953
What do you mean, a fight?

155
00:13:47,988 --> 00:13:49,855
Like, what fight?

156
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,993
Are you going to talk
to me here?

157
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,298
What are you doing?

158
00:13:58,332 --> 00:13:59,599
I'm calling Mom.

159
00:13:59,634 --> 00:14:00,667
Don't do that.

160
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:05,138
Look, I--

161
00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,607
I appreciate
that you're concerned.

162
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,009
I'm fine.

163
00:14:17,052 --> 00:14:21,789
Just do not call your mother.

164
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,725
Why not?

165
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,262
Because...

166
00:14:29,764 --> 00:14:31,198
I was gambling.

167
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:36,569
If you tell your mother,

168
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:39,038
God, I just would--

169
00:14:39,072 --> 00:14:41,874
I would never,
never hear the end of it,

170
00:14:41,908 --> 00:14:43,843
so please...

171
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:51,952
can we just keep this
between us?

172
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:53,487
Would you do that for me?

173
00:14:54,556 --> 00:14:57,959
Just keep it to yourself.

174
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:01,262
I don't understand.

175
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,165
How'd you get into a fight?

176
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,133
And with who?

177
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:21,749
I made a mistake.

178
00:15:29,493 --> 00:15:31,393
And it's my own fault.

179
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,566
I had it coming.

180
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,803
Dad, it's okay.

181
00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,475
It's all my fault.

182
00:15:50,212 --> 00:15:54,850
I just-- I'm sorry.

183
00:15:59,456 --> 00:16:01,023
I'm sorry.

184
00:16:01,058 --> 00:16:03,159
Dad...

185
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:04,627
come here.

186
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:09,898
Come on.
Dad, it's okay.

187
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:12,900
Hey-- Hey--

188
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,236
It's okay.

189
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,070
Please, it's--
it's okay.

190
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,672
Look at me.
Look at me.

191
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:20,841
It's okay.

192
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,010
It is.
Come on.

193
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:24,712
Come on.

194
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:35,056
It's okay.

195
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:44,333
Hey, how was your birthday?

196
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,704
Good.
Get some rest.

197
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:49,905
Okay.

198
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:54,309
The new car?

199
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:58,580
Did you drive it here?

200
00:16:58,614 --> 00:16:59,581
Yeah.

201
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:00,682
Hm.

202
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:03,518
Hm.

203
00:17:03,553 --> 00:17:05,020
That's good.

204
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:07,956
You like it?

205
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:12,361
Uh, sure.

206
00:17:12,395 --> 00:17:14,063
I do.

207
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,100
It drives great.

208
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:20,804
That's good, Jesse.

209
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:39,406
Yes.

210
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,774
Well done.

211
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:46,480
First of many.

212
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:51,118
Yeah?

213
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:52,252
What's that mean?

214
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:53,353
You're staying.

215
00:19:53,388 --> 00:19:55,188
You belong to the cartel now.

216
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:05,801
You can't come
to my work like this.

217
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,469
You're too recognizable.

218
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:09,505
Your face is plastered

219
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,675
on every bus bench
within a 5-mile radius.

220
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:14,644
Celebrities have
to get their cars washed,

221
00:20:14,678 --> 00:20:16,712
just like everybody else.

222
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:19,315
Look, I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

223
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:21,316
Okay?
What is it?

224
00:20:21,351 --> 00:20:24,953
I went ahead and met
with your Mr. Beneke,

225
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:29,257
which I will say again,
loudly and for the record, bad idea.

226
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:33,127
Yes, but it is better
than prison. Correct?

227
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:34,461
Marginally,

228
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:36,830
which is why I disbursed
the funds as you requested.

229
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:38,332
All right, good.

230
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,835
Yeah, I can't believe
he actually bought it--

231
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,470
"Great-aunt Birgit."

232
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:45,107
What?
But you called it.

233
00:20:45,141 --> 00:20:47,610
I guess people see those zeroes
dance before their eyes,

234
00:20:47,644 --> 00:20:49,112
it's kind
of like highway hypnosis.

235
00:20:49,146 --> 00:20:50,213
All right,
so what's the problem?

236
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,215
Let's just say you and I

237
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:54,317
don't wear the same
rose-colored glasses

238
00:20:54,351 --> 00:20:56,486
where Johnny Fabulous
is concerned,

239
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,087
so I kept an eye
on his bank accounts,

240
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,822
and I pulled his credit report.

241
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:02,958
If you would,
note the time on that.

242
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:10,567
3:54 p.m. yesterday.

243
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,536
Three hours
after leaving my office.

244
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,940
He bought a Mercedes SL550.

245
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,343
He's actually leasing it,
but he put 4,500 down.

246
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,078
He's going to pay
1,830 a month--

247
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,546
fully loaded.

248
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:23,548
I mean, he even got
the heated steering wheel,

249
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,484
but that's upwards of 6,300

250
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,421
that won't be going to the IRS.

251
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,589
I just thought
you might like to know,

252
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:32,926
loath as I am to say
I told you so.

253
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,134
Where is he now?

254
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:39,994
Hey.

255
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:45,399
How you doing?

256
00:22:48,203 --> 00:22:49,937
Good.

257
00:22:57,512 --> 00:22:59,480
How are you?

258
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:04,753
I'm fine, but your mother
is going to be worried sick.

259
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:07,956
I called her last night.

260
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:15,163
I told her I was spending
the night at Louis'.

261
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,231
It's cool.

262
00:23:17,266 --> 00:23:21,703
So h-h-how are you?

263
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,240
I'm fine, son.

264
00:23:26,274 --> 00:23:27,475
I--

265
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,379
I--

266
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:38,585
I took these painkillers

267
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
that I had left over
from my surgery,

268
00:23:40,655 --> 00:23:43,490
and I made
the brilliant decision

269
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,892
to wash them down
with a couple of beers.

270
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,397
Not my most sterling moment,
I admit,

271
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:54,800
but I'm fine.

272
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:58,204
I wish I could take back
last night.

273
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,406
It was your birthday.
This shouldn't be on your mind.

274
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:02,074
It's okay.

275
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,242
No, it's not okay.

276
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:04,844
I'm your father,

277
00:24:04,878 --> 00:24:06,613
and I don't want

278
00:24:06,647 --> 00:24:09,082
last night to be--

279
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:14,054
I mean, you really--

280
00:24:14,088 --> 00:24:17,257
you can't think of me like...

281
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,094
Like what?

282
00:24:23,932 --> 00:24:27,101
I don't understand.

283
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:41,749
My father died when I was 6.

284
00:24:41,783 --> 00:24:42,983
You knew that, right?

285
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:44,218
Yeah.

286
00:24:47,055 --> 00:24:49,023
He had Huntington's Disease.

287
00:24:49,057 --> 00:24:51,926
It's--

288
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,397
destroys portions of the brain,

289
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:58,867
affects muscle control,
leads to dementia.

290
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:01,102
It's just a nasty disease.

291
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:03,305
It's genetic.

292
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:05,473
It terrified my mother
that I might have it,

293
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:08,977
so they ran tests on me
when I was a kid,

294
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:10,745
but I came up clean.

295
00:25:12,481 --> 00:25:18,487
My father fell very ill
when I was 4 or 5.

296
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:20,355
He spent a lot of time
in the hospital.

297
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,525
My--

298
00:25:26,762 --> 00:25:29,297
My mother would tell me
so many stories

299
00:25:29,331 --> 00:25:31,766
about my father.

300
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:33,735
She would talk about him
all the time.

301
00:25:35,271 --> 00:25:38,072
I knew about his personality,

302
00:25:38,107 --> 00:25:40,008
how he treated people.

303
00:25:40,042 --> 00:25:42,143
I even knew how he liked
his steaks cooked--

304
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:43,411
medium rare.

305
00:25:43,445 --> 00:25:45,279
Just like you.

306
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:51,319
I knew things about my father.

307
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:52,887
I had a lot of information.

308
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:56,690
It's because people
would tell me these things.

309
00:25:56,724 --> 00:26:00,227
They would paint this picture

310
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:03,631
of my father for me,

311
00:26:03,665 --> 00:26:05,800
and I always pretended

312
00:26:05,834 --> 00:26:08,403
that was who I saw, too,

313
00:26:08,437 --> 00:26:09,804
who I remembered,

314
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,207
but it was a lie.

315
00:26:12,242 --> 00:26:19,315
In truth, I only have one real,
actual memory of my father.

316
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:25,487
It must've been
right before he died.

317
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,222
My mother would take me
to the hospital to visit him,

318
00:26:28,257 --> 00:26:31,292
and I remember
the smell in there,

319
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:32,660
the chemicals.

320
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:35,429
It was as if they use up

321
00:26:35,464 --> 00:26:38,032
every single cleaning product
they could find

322
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:39,667
in a 50-mile radius...

323
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:44,106
like they didn't want you
smelling the sick people.

324
00:26:45,842 --> 00:26:47,576
Oh, there was this stench

325
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,111
of Lysol and bleach.

326
00:26:49,145 --> 00:26:51,146
You could just feel it
coating your lungs.

327
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:56,719
Anyway, there,
lying on the bed,

328
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:58,221
is my father.

329
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:04,559
He's all--
He's all twisted up.

330
00:27:07,597 --> 00:27:13,335
And my mom,
she puts me on her lap.

331
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:14,937
She's sitting
on the bed next to him

332
00:27:14,971 --> 00:27:17,839
so I can get
a good look at him...

333
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,543
but really he just scares me...

334
00:27:25,014 --> 00:27:27,682
and he's looking right at me...

335
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:33,253
but I can't even be sure
that he knows who I am.

336
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:41,028
And your grandmother

337
00:27:41,062 --> 00:27:42,696
is talking,

338
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:46,833
trying to be cheerful,
you know, as she does,

339
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:49,936
but the only thing
I could remember

340
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:52,940
is him breathing.

341
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:57,411
Oh, th-- this--

342
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:03,182
this rattling sound,

343
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:06,919
like if you were shaking
an empty spray-paint can.

344
00:28:06,953 --> 00:28:08,420
Huh?

345
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:15,560
Like there was nothing in him.

346
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,267
Anyway...

347
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:29,341
that is the only real memory
that I have of my father.

348
00:28:34,114 --> 00:28:38,183
I don't want you to think of
me the way I was last night.

349
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,821
I don't want that

350
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:44,789
to be the memory you have of me

351
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,324
when I'm gone.

352
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:51,029
R-Remembering you that way...

353
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:55,166
wouldn't be so bad.

354
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,839
The bad way to remember you
would be the way--

355
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:05,310
the way you've been
this whole last year.

356
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,781
At least last night
you were--

357
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,149
you were real.

358
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:13,751
You know?

359
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:21,925
Bye.

360
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:53,791
Somewhere you should be?

361
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:00,265
Basically it was
a temporary hiatus,

362
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,466
but you give us two weeks,

363
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:04,636
we will be up and running 100%.

364
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:07,239
All right, you talk to your
people and get back to me. Okay?

365
00:30:09,709 --> 00:30:11,710
Yeah, thanks, Tanya.

366
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:13,111
Okay, you bet.

367
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:14,513
Say hi to the kids for me.

368
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:16,615
Hey.
Hi.

369
00:30:17,651 --> 00:30:18,951
Nice surprise.

370
00:30:18,986 --> 00:30:20,286
What's up?

371
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,789
Just thought I'd swing by,
see how things were going.

372
00:30:22,823 --> 00:30:24,324
Well, things are--

373
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,260
...things took a turn.

374
00:30:26,294 --> 00:30:27,361
It's kind of crazy.

375
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:28,728
Oh, yeah?

376
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,130
I think the universe is trying
to tell me something.

377
00:30:30,165 --> 00:30:32,633
I've got some good news,
some very good news,

378
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:36,236
and getting
the business going again.

379
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:39,639
Wow.

380
00:30:39,674 --> 00:30:41,975
Yeah, I figure
we haven't been down long,

381
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:43,744
so we should be able to get
most of our old contracts back.

382
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:45,012
Sit down.

383
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:46,413
Oh, thank you.

384
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:50,050
That's-- gosh, that's--

385
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,952
that's wow.

386
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:55,221
How is that even possible?

387
00:30:55,255 --> 00:31:01,361
I got a very unexpected
cash infusion.

388
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:02,562
Huh.

389
00:31:02,597 --> 00:31:04,932
Guess someone's
looking out for me.

390
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:07,234
I guess so.

391
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:10,872
Is that yours outside?

392
00:31:10,906 --> 00:31:14,176
Oh, yeah, you know.

393
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,679
Can't be driving a piece of
crap to customer meetings.

394
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:18,180
You've got to present
that successful image.

395
00:31:18,214 --> 00:31:19,481
Yeah, right, right.

396
00:31:19,516 --> 00:31:23,653
So the IRS stuff--
that's resolved?

397
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,388
Yeah, it's in progress.

398
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:26,756
So you paid them?

399
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:28,258
Well, not yet, but I will.

400
00:31:29,727 --> 00:31:30,994
When?

401
00:31:31,028 --> 00:31:34,298
Well, it's not that simple.

402
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,067
Um, here's the thing.

403
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:39,302
I never had
proper legal counsel,

404
00:31:39,337 --> 00:31:40,770
so I was thinking

405
00:31:40,805 --> 00:31:43,640
I should hire someone good

406
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:44,974
who can maybe hammer out
a better deal.

407
00:31:45,008 --> 00:31:48,077
There will never be
a better deal, Ted.

408
00:31:48,111 --> 00:31:50,645
The deal is you pay
your back taxes,

409
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,847
you pay your penalty,

410
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:53,781
and you don't go to prison.

411
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:55,249
That's a good deal,

412
00:31:55,283 --> 00:31:58,686
so let's keep our priorities
straight here, right?

413
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,924
Well, my priority
is getting my business back

414
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,726
and putting my employees
back on the payroll

415
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,529
so they can pay
their mortgages.

416
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:12,198
Right, but I think
your employees would agree

417
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:15,335
that you need to get your
financial situation in control

418
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,603
before you can help them.

419
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:20,373
Boy, IRS got you on commission?

420
00:32:20,408 --> 00:32:22,509
No, I'm just saying that,
though I really do--

421
00:32:22,544 --> 00:32:26,113
I understand the temptation
to restart the business,

422
00:32:26,147 --> 00:32:27,448
maybe the universe
is telling you

423
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:30,384
that you need
to pay what you owe.

424
00:32:33,555 --> 00:32:36,257
Skyler, this is my money...

425
00:32:40,162 --> 00:32:41,529
and why are we having
this conversation?

426
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,497
You're no longer
a part of my life--

427
00:32:43,532 --> 00:32:47,234
a decision you made,
by the way--

428
00:32:47,268 --> 00:32:49,869
so I don't understand why
you're hectoring me about this.

429
00:32:51,906 --> 00:32:53,372
Ted, this affects both of us.

430
00:32:53,407 --> 00:32:54,673
No, it doesn't.

431
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:56,141
I'm telling you,
you need to drop this.

432
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:59,044
You need to use that money
to pay your bill

433
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,679
by the end of this month,

434
00:33:00,714 --> 00:33:02,515
which you promised the IRS,
in writing,

435
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:03,849
that you would do.

436
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,085
It is that simple.

437
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,088
Okay.

438
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:12,359
Okay, duly noted.

439
00:33:12,393 --> 00:33:14,061
What does that mean?

440
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:17,197
Does that mean yes?
Because I really need a yes here, Ted.

441
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:20,000
All right, Skyler,
I'll tell you what it means.

442
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,836
It means, in the most
respectful way possible,

443
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,104
there's the door,

444
00:33:24,138 --> 00:33:26,773
and I'm inviting you to,
you know--

445
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:28,542
and thank you for your concern,

446
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,210
but I'm done talking
about this.

447
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:03,241
From whom exactly do you think you got
that 600,000, Ted?

448
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:07,278
Great-aunt Birgit?

449
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,448
That was you?

450
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,384
<i>Ja.</i>

451
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:52,401
What is this shit?

452
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:53,602
What, I don't get a vote?

453
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:56,031
I'm supposed to just stay
down here forever?

454
00:34:58,168 --> 00:34:59,668
I promise you this--

455
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:03,640
either we're all going home,
or none of us are.

456
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:06,976
Now settle down.

457
00:35:12,616 --> 00:35:14,250
On your feet.

458
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:13,978
Gustavo.

459
00:36:33,967 --> 00:36:35,568
This is your new employer.

460
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:37,936
You address him as Don Eladio.

461
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:39,405
It's a term of respect.

462
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,749
No.

463
00:38:02,223 --> 00:38:05,091
Zafiro Añejo.

464
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,109
Uh-huh.

465
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:01,748
Gustavo.

466
00:39:01,782 --> 00:39:02,949
<i>Gracias.</i>

467
00:39:07,155 --> 00:39:09,990
Welcome to Mexico.

468
00:39:11,994 --> 00:39:14,195
Now you say

469
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:18,733
<i>"Muchas gracias</i>
<i>a usted, señor."</i>

470
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,150
<i>Salud.</i>

471
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:52,601
<i>Salud.</i>

472
00:39:52,635 --> 00:39:54,703
<i>Salud.</i>

473
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:58,106
Ah...

474
00:40:34,945 --> 00:40:37,513
Uh, no.
Nah, I don't.

475
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:39,648
Come on.
No.

476
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:43,151
Okay.

477
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:02,037
Gustavo...

478
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:11,704
Ow.

479
00:43:19,948 --> 00:43:21,415
<i>Señor.</i>

480
00:44:40,795 --> 00:44:43,564
Make yourself useful.
Find a gun.

481
00:45:27,777 --> 00:45:30,078
I hope the hell that works.

482
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:31,413
Take him.

483
00:45:55,405 --> 00:45:56,638
Keys.

484
00:45:58,808 --> 00:45:59,808
No.

485
00:45:59,842 --> 00:46:01,343
No.

486
00:46:02,645 --> 00:46:04,112
Okay! Okay.

487
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,052
Are you still with us?

488
00:46:11,087 --> 00:46:12,253
Go.

489
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:35,543
Get us out of here, kid.

490
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:59,002

who do this kind of work--

But guess what.

143
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,145
These guys?
They know Mike.

144
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,281
- And Mike knows them.
- What are you telling me?

145
00:10:17,315 --> 00:10:19,850
Mike knows everyone
who does this?

146
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,585
Who do you think
gave me their names?

147
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,587
Okay, Plan B.

Let's say we get lucky,

151
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,497
I mean, incredibly lucky,

152
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:33,767
and find a guy who's
not an undercover cop

153
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,769
or some kind of survivalist
nut-job wannabe.

154
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:40,273
You gotta ask yourself--
How good is good enough?

155
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:41,775
Because whatever goomba we buy

156
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,410
at some point is gonna
come head-to-head

00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,567
Yeah, I saw him.

166
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:10,172
And you tell Saul
before you tell me?

167
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:12,875
Look, he's my lawyer,
same as yours.

168
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,576
Every time I go over there,

169
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:16,345
Saul hassles me about Mike.

170
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:19,282
He's still scared the dude's
gonna come break his legs.

171
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:22,151
So I give him the latest.

172
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:24,287
But what happened exactly?

173
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:27,691
I was at a diner with Mike,

174
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:31,695
and he just shows up.

175
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:34,131
They send me outside
and the two of them talk.

176
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,299
That's it.

177
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:40,170
So this is, like,
a regular thing?

178
00:11:40,205 --> 00:11:42,106
[sighs]

179
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,341
How close were you to him?

180
00:11:44,376 --> 00:11:45,876
Close.

181
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,879
Closer than you
and me right now.

182
00:11:51,483 --> 00:11:52,717
Did he speak to you?

183
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,090
It was over in 10 seconds.

184
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:01,925
Would you just answer?

185
00:12:03,528 --> 00:12:05,362
He said he sees things
in people.

186
00:12:07,098 --> 00:12:10,400
What things? What people?

187
00:12:10,435 --> 00:12:11,902
Me.

188
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,437
He said he sees
something in me.

189
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,645
A month ago,

190
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,881
Gus was trying
to kill both of us,

191
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:26,983
and now he pulls you
out of the lab

192
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,786
and employs you as...

193
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:32,088
what, an assistant gunman?

194
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,191
A tough guy?

195
00:12:34,225 --> 00:12:36,326
Does that make
any sense to you?

196
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:41,064
He says he sees
something in you.

197
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,802
What kind of game
is he playing?

198
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:47,704
Does he think
you're that naive?

199
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:54,077
He can't truly think
that you'd forget--

200
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:56,914
Well, let alone Gale,

201
00:12:56,948 --> 00:12:59,683
let alone Victor,

202
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:02,719
and all the horror that goes
along with all of that.

203
00:13:02,753 --> 00:13:05,522
What about this
girlfriend of yours

204
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,958
and her little brother?

205
00:13:07,992 --> 00:13:11,027
The man looked you
straight in the eye

206
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:13,063
and told you
"no more children,"

207
00:13:13,097 --> 00:13:16,399
but that very night,
that little boy...

208
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,537
he winds up...

209
00:13:23,074 --> 00:13:26,276
Gus can't possibly think
that you'd forget that.

210
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,946
- Okay.
- I mean, all I'm saying is that

211
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,286
is it possible he would think
that you're that weak-willed?

212
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,822
Drop the sales pitch.

213
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:39,524
I'll do it.

214
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:41,760
You'll do what?

215
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:46,832
I'll kill him...

216
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,701
first chance I get.

217
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:01,846
[air blowing]

218
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:12,658
Piña colada?
More like stale bubblegum.

219
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,460
Does anyone actually
want their car to smell like

220
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,629
the bottom of
a sixth-grader's desk?

221
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:18,698
Okay. Hemp? Really?

222
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,566
Yeah, I know.
But you know what they say--

223
00:14:20,601 --> 00:14:22,067
The customer's always right.

224
00:14:22,102 --> 00:14:24,403
Ooh! Speaking of customer,

225
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,172
it's not too late
to have a grand opening.

226
00:14:26,206 --> 00:14:29,575
I was thinking
huge party, balloons,

227
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:31,010
bouncy house for the kids,

228
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,645
you know, make a splash,
get on TV.

229
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,613
Let people know they're
not gonna have to face

230
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:36,681
the eyebrows of doom
when they come in.

231
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:41,253
Marie, how's Hank doing?

232
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:43,756
You know what?
He's doing better.

233
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,091
Really?

234
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:47,794
Yeah. Uh...

235
00:14:47,828 --> 00:14:50,263
lately his mood's improved,

236
00:14:50,298 --> 00:14:53,700
and he's like a maniac
with his P.T.

237
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,536
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah, don't get me wrong.

238
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,505
He's got a long way to go,
but he--

239
00:14:57,539 --> 00:14:58,672
[door opens]

240
00:14:58,707 --> 00:14:59,807
Yeah. I mean--

241
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,675
- Oh, hey.
- Hey!

242
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,343
- Hi, Walt.
- Marie.

243
00:15:03,378 --> 00:15:05,212
- It's good to see you. [Chuckles]
- You, too.

244
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:08,882
Hey, your cashier here
is quite the salesperson.

245
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,950
She just talked me into
something called

246
00:15:10,985 --> 00:15:13,019
the Orbital Paste Wax Buff.

247
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:14,820
Oh, yeah.
No, it's very important

248
00:15:14,854 --> 00:15:16,021
to maintain your clear coat.

249
00:15:16,056 --> 00:15:17,990
Boy, once that goes--
[clicks tongue]

250
00:15:18,024 --> 00:15:19,124
Oh, yeah.

251
00:15:19,158 --> 00:15:21,860
Um, hi.
[nervous chuckle]

252
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:23,095
Hi.

253
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,738
[Skyler] Bogdan was averaging
19 cars during rush hour,

254
00:15:31,772 --> 00:15:33,907
and we are already up to 22--

255
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:35,742
22 actual cars.

256
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:39,813
Lat night, I deposited $3,800.

257
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:45,418
Jesus. How much is that?

258
00:15:45,452 --> 00:15:48,687
$274,000.

259
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:50,222
Give or take.

260
00:15:50,256 --> 00:15:52,424
- Give or take?
- Yeah.

261
00:15:53,627 --> 00:15:55,828
I haven't counted it.

262
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,429
Wait...

263
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:02,234
274,000--
And this is how often?

264
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,870
Every two weeks.

265
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:08,474
Thursday's good
for a drop-off?

266
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,476
Wait, Walt.

267
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,045
Are you telling me

268
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:18,018
you make $7,125,000 a year?

269
00:16:18,052 --> 00:16:20,621
7 1/2 even,

270
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,256
before expenses.

271
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,224
But I can't--

272
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,460
[stammering] This is too much.

273
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:30,229
So it's more than you thought,

274
00:16:30,264 --> 00:16:32,765
and this is somehow bad news?

275
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,501
No, that's not the point.

276
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:39,005
I mean, there is
no car wash in the world

277
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,440
that could do
this kind of business.

278
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:45,878
I mean, this is 9 month's
work here minimum.

279
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:49,381
7 million?
That could take years.

280
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:51,850
So set some aside.
Save it for a rainy day.

281
00:16:51,884 --> 00:16:53,852
Save it. What--

282
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:56,253
Save it where?
I can't go to the bank with it.

283
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:59,022
I sure can't leave it here.

284
00:17:00,324 --> 00:17:01,792
Ohh...
Oi.

285
00:17:01,826 --> 00:17:05,562
Wait a minute.
Is this all 50s?

286
00:17:05,597 --> 00:17:07,698
Who pays for a car wash
with a 50?

287
00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:10,367
Skyler, I didn't
ask you to do this.

288
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,602
I was under the impression

289
00:17:11,636 --> 00:17:13,337
that you had this
under control.

290
00:17:13,372 --> 00:17:17,007
I just didn't expect
this amount of money.

291
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,010
The 50s are gonna be a problem.

292
00:17:19,044 --> 00:17:22,079
Well, that's what this is--
Problem solving.

293
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:24,615
Skyler, this is a simple
division of labor.

294
00:17:24,649 --> 00:17:26,316
I bring in the money,
you launder the money.

295
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:27,684
This is what you wanted.

296
00:17:27,719 --> 00:17:30,254
I never wanted any of this.

297
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:32,423
I've got to go.

298
00:17:32,457 --> 00:17:35,159
If you want out,
just say that you want out.

299
00:17:46,372 --> 00:17:47,839
Okay, then.

300
00:17:51,243 --> 00:17:53,878
[air hissing]

301
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,651
[switch clicks]

302
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,424
[whirring]

303
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:13,733
[whirring]

304
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:24,611
[whirring]

305
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:06,420
You're telling me
you made this in the lab?

306
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:08,456
Why not?

307
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,992
Making it in his own lab...

308
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,627
seemed appropriate.

309
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,730
There's not much of it.

310
00:19:14,764 --> 00:19:16,599
We had more for Tuco.

311
00:19:16,633 --> 00:19:18,735
It's enough.

312
00:19:18,769 --> 00:19:20,870
This is still the best way.

313
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:22,305
You go after him with a gun,

314
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,974
you'll never get
out of it alive.

315
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,976
But with this,

316
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,011
you slip it into
his food or drink,

317
00:19:28,045 --> 00:19:30,614
there shouldn't be
any taste or smell,

318
00:19:30,648 --> 00:19:34,585
36 hours later, poof.

319
00:19:35,587 --> 00:19:37,021
A man his age,

320
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:39,224
working as hard as he does,

321
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:40,925
no one will be surprised.

322
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,065
What about Mike?

323
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,633
Mike can have his suspicions,

324
00:19:48,668 --> 00:19:50,869
but that's all they'll be.

325
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,237
Please,

326
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:54,406
one homicidal maniac at a time.

327
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:07,953
I don't know when
I'm gonna see Gus again...

328
00:20:07,987 --> 00:20:09,354
I mean, if ever.

329
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,159
Keep it with you.

330
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:17,095
When you have the opportunity,

331
00:20:17,129 --> 00:20:18,863
be ready.

332
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:22,968
What if they search me?

333
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,907
Will they do that?

334
00:21:18,925 --> 00:21:21,427
It's the wrong way around.

335
00:21:24,164 --> 00:21:26,599
It's my lucky cigarette.

336
00:21:29,236 --> 00:21:32,872
Well, whatever you do,
don't smoke it.

337
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:37,243
[Walter Jr.] You know they
have a drive-thru, right?

338
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:39,345
[Hank] Nah, this is good.

339
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,647
Could use the exercise.
Get he blood pumping.

340
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:44,016
Don't worry,

341
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,818
you're not gonna
have to pick me up.

342
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:48,854
It might take me a while,
but I'll get there.

343
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,092
Jesus, ain't we a pair?

344
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:56,161
You must really like chicken.

345
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:00,899
V-8, 470 horses,

346
00:22:00,933 --> 00:22:02,501
20-inch rims,

347
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,603
satellite radio, Bluetooth,

348
00:22:04,637 --> 00:22:08,139
0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

349
00:22:08,174 --> 00:22:10,642
Whoa. What do you mean,
on a lark?

350
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:13,144
Spur of the moment,
your dad just ups and buys you

351
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:15,279
a brand-new Challenger?

352
00:22:15,313 --> 00:22:18,615
Yeah, I barely got
around the block

353
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:21,852
and Mom said
we couldn't afford it,

354
00:22:21,886 --> 00:22:23,487
so they took it back.

355
00:22:23,522 --> 00:22:25,356
Do you know how long I had it?

356
00:22:25,391 --> 00:22:27,125
Fifteen hours.

357
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,962
Well, hey, buddy,
let me tell you something.

358
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,898
When I was your age,

359
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,233
I'd have given my left nut

360
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:37,403
to drive a car like that
for 15 minutes.

361
00:22:37,438 --> 00:22:39,706
But seriously,
how does that happen?

362
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,010
Well, we were looking
at used cars,

363
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:44,044
and I kind of--
Ahh.

364
00:22:44,078 --> 00:22:45,278
You guilted him into it.

365
00:22:45,313 --> 00:22:46,680
Yeah, yeah.
I know. I hear you.

366
00:22:46,714 --> 00:22:49,615
You pulled the old "Poor little
me and my little troubles."

367
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,817
- Am I right?
- Maybe.

368
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:53,752
Yeah, well, you flew too
close to the sun, my friend.

369
00:22:53,786 --> 00:22:55,820
You'd have let him
buy you a clunker

370
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,289
you'd be driving now,

371
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:59,891
instead of borrowing
Mom's hooptie.

372
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:01,292
Agent Schrader.

373
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:02,994
- Oh, hey. How you doing?
- Well, thank you.

374
00:23:03,028 --> 00:23:04,195
Good to see you.

375
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:06,531
Walter Junior,
do you remember Mr. Fring?

376
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,733
- How are you?
- Well. Nice to see you again.

377
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,634
It's a pleasure
to see you here.

378
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:11,735
You're looking very well.

379
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,103
Yeah, well, you know,

380
00:23:13,138 --> 00:23:16,039
chalk it up to clean living
and vitamin pills.

381
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:17,107
[chuckles]

382
00:23:17,141 --> 00:23:18,908
I must apologize.

383
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:20,343
If I had seen you come in,

384
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:21,543
there would have been
no question

385
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:22,778
of accepting your money.

386
00:23:22,813 --> 00:23:25,014
In the future,
please feel free to ask for me.

387
00:23:25,048 --> 00:23:27,450
A DEA hero should never have

388
00:23:27,484 --> 00:23:28,918
to pay for a meal
at Pollos Hermanos.

389
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:30,019
No kidding?

390
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:32,922
I'll take you up
on that for sure.

391
00:23:32,956 --> 00:23:34,723
And how are
your mother and father?

392
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:36,558
They're good.

393
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:37,893
The chicken is great.

394
00:23:37,927 --> 00:23:39,361
Thank you.

395
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:41,997
If ever you're interested
in rewarding part-time work,

396
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,999
perhaps something after school?

397
00:23:44,034 --> 00:23:45,034
My door is always open.

398
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:46,736
Sounds good.

399
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,538
Uh, I don't know
about this one.

400
00:23:48,572 --> 00:23:51,208
He might eat up
all your profits.

401
00:23:51,242 --> 00:23:53,143
Well, I'll let you
finish your meal.

402
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,878
Can I get you anything else?

403
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:56,680
A refill, perhaps?

404
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,282
No, thank you.
I'm good.

405
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:00,618
Sure. Take a Diet Coke.
Thank you very much.

406
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:01,953
Of course.

407
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:27,544
[door slams]

408
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,601
So where are we going?

409
00:24:36,636 --> 00:24:41,340
Oh, big doings today.

410
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:47,114
The order of the day
is eyes open, mouth shut.

411
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:31,325
S'up?

412
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:42,737
Test, test.

413
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:44,505
You got me?

414
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
Count off.

415
00:25:54,917 --> 00:25:55,951
[door slams]

416
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:58,220
Let's go.

417
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:03,326
Right here.
Leave the wrap on, please.

418
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:07,731
You know how to make coffee?

419
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,234
Sure.

420
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,569
There you go.

421
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,874
- You want a rundown?
- Please.

422
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:19,043
Three guys
up at the gate--

423
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,544
Two visible, one in the blind.

424
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,614
We got five guys down here
with a backup out of sight.

425
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:27,050
I got Tyrus
down in the treeline

426
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:28,284
with a Barret .50.

427
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:29,552
Planted him there last night

428
00:26:29,586 --> 00:26:31,386
in case we had
any early arrivals.

429
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:32,421
[voice fades]

430
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,060
[loud dripping]

431
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:39,994
[machine whirring]

432
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:52,040
[loud dripping]

433
00:26:52,074 --> 00:26:54,075
[groans]

434
00:26:57,347 --> 00:26:59,448
I don't have an extra holster.

435
00:26:59,483 --> 00:27:01,183
You stick this in your pocket.

436
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:03,519
Keep it out of sight.

437
00:27:03,553 --> 00:27:06,389
If you're gonna be here today,
you're gonna have a gun.

438
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,462
It's loaded?

439
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:14,764
[sighs]

440
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:16,331
I don't want to see
that in your hand

441
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:17,799
unless you see me with mine.

442
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,201
Understood?

443
00:27:19,235 --> 00:27:21,303
Emergency only.

444
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:24,639
First car is coming.

445
00:27:29,211 --> 00:27:31,779
All right, what's
the order of the day?

446
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:33,448
Eyes open, mouth shut.

447
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,218
A lot of guns.

448
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:43,320
Nobody's asking you
to give up yours.

449
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,860
You want to sweep the place
before you bring in your guys?

450
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,330
I am the guy.

451
00:28:55,635 --> 00:28:57,035
All right, then.

452
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,242
[all speaking Spanish]

453
00:31:52,013 --> 00:31:53,780
You got something of mine?

454
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:02,224
Glove box.

455
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:09,632
Figure I better
teach you how to shoot.

456
00:32:09,666 --> 00:32:11,534
Could be things
are gonna get hairy.

457
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:17,105
What is this?

458
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,840
You're giving me a gun?

459
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:23,510
And now I'm, like, part
of the team or whatever?

460
00:32:23,545 --> 00:32:24,778
[sighs]

461
00:32:26,714 --> 00:32:28,715
He said he sees
something in me.

462
00:32:30,718 --> 00:32:31,751
Like what?

463
00:32:35,923 --> 00:32:39,626
If I had to put it in a word...

464
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,628
I'd guess...

465
00:32:41,662 --> 00:32:43,230
loyalty.

466
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,598
Loyalty.

467
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:51,804
Only maybe you got it
for the wrong guy.

468
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:10,810
Jesse?

469
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,413
Hey.

470
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:14,414
Hey.

471
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:15,815
Long time, no see.

472
00:33:18,753 --> 00:33:20,120
How you doing?

473
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:22,689
Yeah, you know, uh...

474
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:23,957
good.

475
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:25,859
Good.

476
00:33:25,893 --> 00:33:27,227
Good.

477
00:33:29,397 --> 00:33:31,299
Okay, we're going
to get started.

478
00:33:31,333 --> 00:33:32,466
You coming in?

479
00:33:36,572 --> 00:33:38,973
So the truth is
we can't change the past.

480
00:33:39,008 --> 00:33:40,108
What's done is done.

481
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:41,876
We've got to own our actions,

482
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,011
but putting ourselves on trial,

483
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:46,681
acting as our own judge,
jury, and executioner,

484
00:33:46,715 --> 00:33:47,848
it's not the answer

485
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:50,451
because a lot of the time
all that judging does

486
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:54,823
is just ensure that we're
going to repeat the cycle.

487
00:33:54,857 --> 00:33:55,991
Right.

488
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,461
"I'm such an asshhole."

489
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,630
"It's totally hopeless."

490
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,299
"What's the point?"

491
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,335
"I think I'll have a hit."

492
00:34:06,637 --> 00:34:07,804
Jesse.

493
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,741
What's going on
with you these days?

494
00:34:14,112 --> 00:34:15,078
[sigh]

495
00:34:15,113 --> 00:34:18,348
I went back to the crystal.

496
00:34:18,383 --> 00:34:20,150
You sober now?

497
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:21,552
Yeah.

498
00:34:21,586 --> 00:34:24,655
Four days.
Big whoop, right?

499
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:26,590
Four days is four days.

500
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,192
You're here.

501
00:34:28,226 --> 00:34:33,697
You still...
working at the laundry?

502
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:35,166
How are things there.

503
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,702
Sucks ass.

504
00:34:37,737 --> 00:34:38,737
[chuckling]

505
00:34:40,506 --> 00:34:42,441
Anything
you want to talk about?

506
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:47,714
Uh...

507
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:54,287
a couple of weeks back...

508
00:34:55,856 --> 00:34:57,357
I, uh...

509
00:34:57,391 --> 00:34:59,726
killed a dog.

510
00:35:02,729 --> 00:35:04,963
You hit it with your car?

511
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,434
No, um...

512
00:35:10,669 --> 00:35:12,270
I put him down.

513
00:35:13,673 --> 00:35:15,708
I watched him go.

514
00:35:15,742 --> 00:35:17,977
I was looking him
straight in the eye

515
00:35:18,011 --> 00:35:19,011
and...

516
00:35:21,382 --> 00:35:22,983
you know, he didn't know
what was happening.

517
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:24,518
He didn't know why.
He--

518
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,291
He was just scared, and then...

519
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:33,396
he was gone.

520
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:36,065
He was suffering.

521
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,001
It was a kindness.

522
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,271
No, he wasn't sick.

523
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,242
No, he was just, like a...

524
00:35:47,978 --> 00:35:50,613
I don't know, like a...

525
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,082
problem dog.

526
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,051
What did he do?

527
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:56,285
Bite someone?

528
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,093
Uh, this dog never--
never bit anybody.

529
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:04,628
He was, uh...

530
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:09,133
You pick up the rock,
you go right to the dark side.

531
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,235
Anything can happen.

532
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:13,003
It ain't no rock
that made me do it.

533
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,305
Well, what was the problem?

534
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:15,506
Why did you have to kill him?

535
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,375
Watch the cross-talk,
please.

536
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,679
Maybe it's not the details
that matter.

537
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,347
Right?

538
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,050
How'd you feel about
what you did, Jesse?

539
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,155
I don't know.

540
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,693
Who cares how you feel?

541
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:38,397
What kind of a person
kills a dog for no reason?

542
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,631
Colleen.

543
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:41,099
You put an ad in the paper.

544
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:42,367
You drop him off at a shelter.

545
00:36:42,401 --> 00:36:43,635
- Colleen--
- You just don't sit there

546
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:44,836
and talk about killing
a helpless--

547
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:46,205
- Colleen.
- ...innocent animal.

548
00:36:47,674 --> 00:36:49,975
We're not here
to sit in judgment.

549
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:52,077
Why not?

550
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,749
Why not? Maybe--
Maybe she's right.

551
00:36:56,783 --> 00:36:58,284
You know, maybe I should
have put it in the paper.

552
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:00,753
Maybe I should have
done something different.

553
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:04,557
The thing is,

554
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:08,294
if you just do stuff
and nothing happens...

555
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,531
what's it all mean?

556
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:14,366
What's the point?

557
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:20,706
All right, this whole thing
is about self-acceptance.

558
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,441
Kicking the hell
out of yourself

559
00:37:22,475 --> 00:37:24,176
doesn't give meaning
to anything.

560
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:27,847
So I should stop judging...

561
00:37:29,149 --> 00:37:31,884
- and accept--
- [Man] It's a start.

562
00:37:31,919 --> 00:37:34,387
So, no matter what I do,

563
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,956
hooray for me
because I'm a great guy?

564
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:38,959
It's all good?

565
00:37:38,993 --> 00:37:41,262
No matter how many dogs I kill,

566
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:44,199
I just what, do an inventory

567
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,967
and accept?

568
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,107
I mean, you back your truck
over your own kid

569
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:53,176
and you, like, accept?

570
00:37:54,678 --> 00:37:56,146
What a load of crap!

571
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:59,082
Hey, Jesse,
I know you're in pain.

572
00:37:59,116 --> 00:38:00,350
No, y-you know what?

573
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:04,520
Why I'm here
in the first place?

574
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:09,192
Is to sell you meth.

575
00:38:12,162 --> 00:38:15,498
You're nothing to me
but customers!

576
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:21,470
I made you my bitch.

577
00:38:21,504 --> 00:38:23,872
You okay with that?

578
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:25,306
Huh?

579
00:38:25,341 --> 00:38:27,208
You accept?

580
00:38:29,678 --> 00:38:30,845
No.

581
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,389
About time.

582
00:39:06,181 --> 00:39:07,515
[cough]

583
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:15,222
Jesse. Jesse.

584
00:39:15,256 --> 00:39:17,458
Bring that light
over here, will you?

585
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,860
[cough]

586
00:39:30,305 --> 00:39:32,205
You see any residue there?

587
00:39:33,374 --> 00:39:34,340
Where?

588
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:38,011
Here. On the bottom,
right-- right there.

589
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,248
[whispering] It's been a week.

590
00:39:42,282 --> 00:39:44,283
What's going on?

591
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:46,386
I haven't seen him.

592
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:50,256
I didn't think so,

593
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,124
but I'll just give it
another shot anyway.

594
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,715
- Hey-hey-hey, buddy!
- Hey.

595
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:20,451
Look at that.
Graduated to doorman.

596
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:21,820
Finally found your calling.

597
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:24,689
Ha ha! Ooh!
Little whiskers, Marie.

598
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:28,260
What did you do, show your
barber a picture of a dog's ass

599
00:40:28,294 --> 00:40:29,628
and said "I'll take that"?

600
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:33,097
Charming as usual.
Welcome back.

601
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,498
Looking good, Marie.

602
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,233
Oh, thanks, Steve.
Good to see you.

603
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,634
- How you doing?
- He's doing fine.

604
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,269
We, uh, we can
take it from here.

605
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,637
- Right, Gomie?
- Yeah.

606
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,739
If you want to hold his elbow.

607
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,406
No, no, no, no.
You keep your mitts off me.

608
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,708
I'm good, I'm good.

609
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:50,579
[Marie] Hey.

610
00:40:52,215 --> 00:40:53,582
Good luck.

611
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,990
Let's go.
Running late. Come on.

612
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:08,199
Hank,
seeing you walk in--

613
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,501
I can't tell you what that
means to all of us.

614
00:41:10,536 --> 00:41:13,804
Your progress, it's incredible.

615
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,673
Yeah, well, chalk it up

616
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,308
to can living
and vitamin pills.

617
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:19,944
Steve tell you his news?

618
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:23,413
What?
Finally got your period?

619
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:25,248
I made GS 14.

620
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,283
Wow.
That's all right, man.

621
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,985
Next stop,
Washington, D.C.,

622
00:41:29,019 --> 00:41:30,619
sitting behind a desk,

623
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,488
papers piled so high,
you can't see over them.

624
00:41:32,522 --> 00:41:34,857
Hey, better you than me, buddy.

625
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:36,992
Seriously,
congratulations, buddy.

626
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,160
Thanks.

627
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:41,263
Steve said you might
have something for us.

628
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:42,431
Yeah, maybe.

629
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:44,967
You guys are going
to have to tell me.

630
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,670
Remember my pal Tim Roberts?

631
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:49,372
APD detective?

632
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,607
Yeah, well, he's working
on a murder case,

633
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:54,143
and the victim's
a 34-year-old male Caucasian

634
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:56,344
by the name of Gale Boetticher.

635
00:41:56,379 --> 00:41:58,880
One night last month,
Boetticher opens the door--

636
00:41:58,915 --> 00:42:01,582
Bam, take a bullet to the face

637
00:42:01,617 --> 00:42:04,518
from a person
or persons unknown.

638
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:08,655
Now, this Gale Boetticher is
a bona fide chemistry genius.

639
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,625
I mean, he's got degrees
up the wazoo, right?

640
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:16,296
And, uh, as you might expect,
he's a nerd's nerd.

641
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:19,266
Vegan, sandals and socks
kind of guy.

642
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:24,638
As it turns out, he's also
an A-number 1 meth cook.

643
00:42:24,673 --> 00:42:26,474
And what caught my eye

644
00:42:26,508 --> 00:42:30,045
is, uh, his specialty
product's blue.

645
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,214
So what are you thinking?

646
00:42:32,248 --> 00:42:33,849
This is your Heisenberg?

647
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:37,753
No. What I think we got here
is, uh, ahem,

648
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,755
Heisenberg's former cook

649
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:43,526
and maybe a line
on Heisenberg himself.

650
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,496
Anyway, uh, lo and behold,

651
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:50,666
amidst all the hippie-dippie
nonsense, ahem,

652
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,268
I find this.

653
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:56,706
Now, this here
I do a little Google-fu,

654
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,208
and I-- I realize
it's a parts number

655
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,978
specifically for this baby.

656
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:04,547
Now, that there
is a high-volume

657
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:08,785
HEPA industrial
air filtration system.

658
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,088
That's a $300,000 gadget.

659
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,624
Perfect
for a pharmaceutical plant

660
00:43:13,658 --> 00:43:15,325
or microchip factory

661
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,097
or maybe the biggest meth lab
north of the border.

662
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,201
Okay.

663
00:43:24,236 --> 00:43:27,038
So this little dingus here
is manufactured

664
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:29,874
by a big
international concern--

665
00:43:29,908 --> 00:43:32,143
Madrigal Electromotive.

666
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:34,612
I call their Houston office,
and eventually I get through

667
00:43:34,647 --> 00:43:36,948
to the nicest little
20-year-old temp.

668
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:39,216
I use some of the Schrader
sweet talk on her.

669
00:43:39,251 --> 00:43:41,218
Before you know it,
she's pulling files for me.

670
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,586
Turns out six months ago,

671
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,654
one of these systems
was shipped to a depot

672
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,690
right here in ABQ.

673
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,992
Who signed for it?

674
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,560
Gale Boetticher.

675
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:53,697
So I asked my new girlfriend
who paid for it,

676
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,967
and she says "Nobody."

677
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:58,870
They have no record

678
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:01,774
that anybody actually
paid for this thing.

679
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:05,545
So I go back and push more,
and before you know it,

680
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:07,781
uh, the temp's gone,
there's no forwarding address,

681
00:44:07,815 --> 00:44:09,950
and I'm talking to some
snot-nose corporate lawyer

682
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:11,818
who's asking me
for my badge number.

683
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:14,455
Brick wall.

684
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,692
So I take a peek
into Madrigal Electromotive.

685
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:21,695
Now, Madrigal is based
in Hanover, Germany,

686
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,498
but they're what they call
highly diversified--

687
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:27,268
Industrial equipment,
global shipping,

688
00:44:27,303 --> 00:44:28,536
major construction,

689
00:44:28,571 --> 00:44:32,975
and a tiny little foothold
in American fast food,

690
00:44:33,009 --> 00:44:35,612
specifically a local chain--

691
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:37,714
Pollos Hermanos.

692
00:44:40,919 --> 00:44:42,686
Okay. So what, right?

693
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,954
Boetticher's dead.

694
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:46,157
I got no line on who's
been bankrolling him

695
00:44:46,191 --> 00:44:48,860
or where his lab was.

696
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,128
The whole thing's
a snipe hunt, right?

697
00:44:51,163 --> 00:44:55,433
But now I get this crazy idea,

698
00:44:55,467 --> 00:44:58,002
and I can't shake it.

699
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:01,838
I mean, I-- I stay up nights
staring at the ceiling

700
00:45:01,873 --> 00:45:03,039
and trying to make sense of it.

701
00:45:03,074 --> 00:45:04,274
It's that napkin.

702
00:45:04,308 --> 00:45:05,942
Remember I told you
Boetticher's vegan, right?

703
00:45:05,976 --> 00:45:06,976
I mean, we're talking
this guy makes

704
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:09,445
his own fermented lentil bread

705
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:12,048
or whatever the hell that is.

706
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:16,485
What's a vegan doing
in a fried chicken joint?

707
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:22,526
Maybe he's meeting somebody.

708
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,495
Like who?

709
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,031
Well, like maybe...

710
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,702
this guy.

711
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:37,508
I mean, what do we know
about Gustavo Fring?

712
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:40,711
Huh? This whole "friend
of law enforcement" thing, eh,

713
00:45:40,745 --> 00:45:44,113
could be a case of keep your friends
close but your enemies closer.

714
00:45:44,148 --> 00:45:46,349
He's got the money
to finance this operation.

715
00:45:46,383 --> 00:45:47,750
Maybe he's got
the connections, too.

716
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:50,385
Maybe, just maybe...

717
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,953
he's our guy.

718
00:45:56,093 --> 00:45:57,693
Hank, no offense,

719
00:45:57,728 --> 00:45:59,929
but I think
you're really reaching.

720
00:45:59,963 --> 00:46:03,700
If your guy
had his meeting at KFC,

721
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:05,536
you wouldn't immediately assume

722
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:07,605
that he's sitting down
with Colonel Sanders.

723
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,573
You know, I-- ahem--

724
00:46:09,608 --> 00:46:12,677
I couldn't agree more, guys.

725
00:46:12,711 --> 00:46:17,448
Gustavo Fring, blue meth,
you know...

726
00:46:17,482 --> 00:46:22,387
The whole thing
is off-the-map nuts.

727
00:46:22,421 --> 00:46:24,990
I ought to be wearing
a tinfoil hat, you know?

728
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,426
Except...

729
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:33,765
I can't seem to wrap my mind
around this one little thing,

730
00:46:33,799 --> 00:46:35,634
and that is...

731
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,571
what are Gustavo Fring's
fingerprints...

732
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,274
doing in Gale Boetticher's
apartment?

733
00:46:54,828 --> 00:46:58,000

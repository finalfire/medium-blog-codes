00:00:07,715 --> 00:00:11,872
I think Brock may have been poisoned
with something called ricin.

4
00:00:12,008 --> 00:00:15,381
Shut up!
Why did you poison him?

5
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:19,168
Who do you know? Gus allowed
children to be murdered. Gus!

6
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:21,235
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Then let me help.

00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,963
Don't go! Don't go!
No! No!

What did you say to Gus?

Because he's on to us.
Yeah.

15
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,016
I didn't say jack.
What do you mean he's on to us?

16
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,019
He's walking to his car.
Then suddenly he isn't.

17
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:45,255
What, does he have
some kind of sixth sense?

18
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,958
Jesus, what did you say to him?

19
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:50,695
Could I ask my own question
right now, at this point?

20
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,232
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

21
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:56,703
What? Was I supposed
to leave it on his car?

22
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:58,738
What, you're supposed
to bring it into a hospital?

23

[panting] Oh, my God.

24
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:06,546
Look. Where can we find Gus?
Name a place.

25
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,514
Name me one place
where I could surprise him,

26
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,882
where he won't see me coming.

27
00:02:11,385 --> 00:02:15,154
Because his house, the laundry,

28
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:16,989
the restaurant,
the factory farm,

29
00:02:17,023 --> 00:02:18,457
they're all wired with cameras.

30
00:02:18,492 --> 00:02:20,893
One place.

31
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,328
Think.

32
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:23,563
Jesse, think.

33
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:25,799
Where is it?
Where?

34
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,468
Because if you can't tell me,

35
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:30,704
we are dead.

I don't-- I don't know.

Hi.
Detective Kalanchoe.

43
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,963
This is Detective Munn,
Albuquerque Police.

44
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:57,532
We were wondering if we could
have a few minutes of your time,

45
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,000
maybe go someplace and talk.

46
00:02:59,035 --> 00:03:00,301
About what?

47
00:03:00,336 --> 00:03:01,870
Sorry, sir,
I didn't catch your name.

48
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:03,038
About what?

49
00:03:03,072 --> 00:03:04,941
It concerns Brock Cantillo

50
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,543
and a statement
you made to his mother.

51
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:09,212
How about you come with us?

52
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,581
We just want to clear
a few things up. No big deal.

[Kalanchoe]
No, you're not under arrest.

56
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:54,661
We're just talking.

57
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:56,463
So if I get tired of talking,

58
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:57,731
want to get up and leave--

59
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,166
We'd prefer you didn't.

60
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:02,436
You'd prefer, so--

61
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,970
Jesse, why did you
tell Brock's mom

62
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:07,040
that the boy had been poisoned?

63
00:04:07,074 --> 00:04:12,111
Look, I think this has been,
you know,

64
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:13,746
uh, what do you call it?

65
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,016
Overblown, because
all I basically said was

66
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,087
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

67
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,256
You know, in a cover-all-bases
kind of sense.

68
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,959
Yeah. No, I'm sure
they appreciated that,

69
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:27,594
you helping them out like that,

70
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:29,663
especially with how specific
you were and all.

71
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:31,699
Ricin. Wow.

72
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:34,135
[Kalanchoe] Yeah, ricin--
that's definitely a big one.

73
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:35,437
You don't see that every day,

74
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:36,938
so when doctors,
they hear that,

75
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:38,974
they take it very seriously,

76
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,944
as do we,

77
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,712
as does the FBI.

78
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,180
Okay.

79
00:04:44,214 --> 00:04:46,817
And nice, you trying to
help out like that and all,

80
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:48,952
you know,
professional courtesy,

81
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,121
sharing your expertise.

82
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:54,258
I ain't go no expertise.

83
00:04:54,292 --> 00:04:55,826
All right?
I just, you know--

84
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:58,228
You just happen to guess
this one rare poison

85
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,998
might be the thing that put this
little boy in the hospital.

86
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,434
And congratulations,
because his doctors,

87
00:05:03,468 --> 00:05:06,070
they're beginning to think
that you might just be right.

88
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:07,771
So why ricin?

89
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,040
Jesse, how did you come up
with that?

90
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:11,842
[sighs]
Man, I think I've--

91
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:14,612
I don't know. I must've saw it
on <i>House</i> or something.

92
00:05:14,646 --> 00:05:15,680
Huh.

93
00:05:15,714 --> 00:05:16,748
Yeah, you know, like <i>House</i>

94
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:19,083
or the Discovery Channel.

95
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:21,986
Sometimes your brain just
makes these connections.

96
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,988
- Does it?
- Mine does.

97
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:25,923
That's interesting.

98
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,626
Look, I've got to get back.

99
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,327
But we're still talking.

100
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:34,732
So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

101
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:42,239
So, then, I guess I should
call my lawyer. Right?

102
00:05:42,274 --> 00:05:45,475
We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

103
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,378
Why can't we keep talking,
keep it light?

104
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,814
Man, you know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

Adversarial. Then we gotta
book you, blah, blah. Right?

109
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,958
I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,694
You're no boy scout.

111
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,598
Saul Goodman.

112
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:09,768
That's my guy.

113
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,604
So do I gotta call him,
or do you?

Is he here?

something to you.

137
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,865
- My partner and I--
- Are in danger?

Whoop-dee-freaking-doo.

00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,767
Why do you think he's not here?

140
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:18,703
And how's that news, exactly,

141
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:20,838
the two of you being in danger,

142
00:07:20,872 --> 00:07:22,673
after doing something idiotic?

143
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:25,509
And what gives you the right
to break down my door?

144
00:07:25,544 --> 00:07:28,312
Look, I just need a number.
Okay? That's all.

145
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:30,448
You are such a pain in my ass.

146
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,049
You know that?

147
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,351
You're the reason
I've got to go on unemployment

148
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,152
for God knows how long.

149
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,320
I was at least looking forward

150
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,955
to getting out of here
in the next half hour,

151
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,990
but no!

152
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,791
Now I've got to wait
around all day

153
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:42,859
for a plate glass guy
to come and fix this door,

154
00:07:42,894 --> 00:07:43,994
and who pays for this?

155
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:46,429
Okay, you know what?

156
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:48,231
Here, look.
I'm giving you everything,

157
00:07:48,265 --> 00:07:49,699
all of it, okay?

158
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:51,533
There's one, two, three--

159
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,103
Look, there's got to be
at least $1,700 there, okay?

160
00:07:55,138 --> 00:07:56,638
That will more than cover
the cost of the door.

161
00:07:56,672 --> 00:07:58,473
Now, I apologize profusely.

162
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:00,442
Please, the phone number.

163
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,981

he was torturing the old guy.

What does that mean?

He told him the last

He seemed to enjoy telling him.

Afterward, Pinkman
asked him about it.

292

All Gus would say
was that this Tio character

No?

What do you need?

Want me to get

Okay.

Finish the word,
Mr. Salamanca.

367
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:28,165
Is it "dear"?

Is it "deal"?

369
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,641
Honey, "dea" ain't a word.

370
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,009
Help me out here.

373
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:08,269
Hey, son, what's up?

374
00:21:08,304 --> 00:21:10,939
When exactly
are you getting here?

375
00:21:10,974 --> 00:21:13,676
<i>Uh, just as soon as I can.</i>

376
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,611
Look, this is
a serious situation,

377
00:21:15,645 --> 00:21:17,446
and it's like you're not
taking it seriously.

378
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:18,815
Give me the phone.
Let me talk to him.

379
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,450
<i>[Walt]</i> <i>No, son, I am
taking it</i> <i>very seriously.</i>

380
00:21:20,484 --> 00:21:22,319
Just-- Just give it to me,
Walt.

381
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,056
<i>I'm very concerned</i> <i>about your
Uncle Hank</i> <i>and his safety,</i>

382
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:29,193
but whomever is making
these threats against him,

383
00:21:29,227 --> 00:21:32,396
I can assure you there's
no interest in me.

384
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:34,832
I'm not on--
on anyone's radar,

385
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,467
<i>- and besides your mother and I.</i>
- Give it to me.

386
00:21:36,501 --> 00:21:37,701
Walter?

387
00:21:37,736 --> 00:21:39,169
Did you hear what he said?

388
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:40,504
Get over here.

389
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,039
<i>No more excuses.</i>

390
00:21:42,074 --> 00:21:44,941
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

391
00:21:44,976 --> 00:21:46,243
- I promise.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

392
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,079
You want to weigh in here?

393
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:50,914
Maybe you could talk
some sense into him.

394
00:21:50,949 --> 00:21:54,084
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here, so just...

395
00:21:57,388 --> 00:21:59,589
Well, I hope you sell
plenty of air fresheners.

396
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:02,258
<i>I hope you just have</i>
<i>a banner day over there.</i>

397
00:22:02,292 --> 00:22:03,493
<i>Okay, Walt?</i>

398
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:04,894
<i>Don't worry</i> <i>about a thing here.</i>

399
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,063
Goodbye.

400
00:22:07,097 --> 00:22:08,798
And thank you

401
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:11,367
for all of your help.

402
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:12,668
Huh?

403
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,544
Anything?

404
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:41,463
- Hi, everyone.
[Skyler] - Hi, Steve.

405
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,564
How's everybody holding up?

406
00:22:42,598 --> 00:22:44,499
Hey, Gomie,
just the man I want to see.

407
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:45,667
Come here, look at this.

408
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:49,070
Jesus, enough with the laundry.

409
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,772
No, no, no, hear me out.

410
00:22:50,806 --> 00:22:52,907
This panel,
if I'm reading it correctly,

411
00:22:52,942 --> 00:22:55,143
is a 7,200-amp service.

412
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:56,277
This place has two of them.

413
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,411
[sighs] All right?

414
00:22:57,446 --> 00:22:59,480
That's a whole lot of juice,
brother.

415
00:22:59,515 --> 00:23:02,383
Laundry this size typically
has maybe half that, okay?

416
00:23:02,418 --> 00:23:04,118
So what's with the extra panel?

417
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:05,619
What are you,
Thomas Edison now?

418
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:07,355
No, I asked
a bunch of electricians.

419
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,689
[chuckles] They have
their own chat rooms,

420
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:11,125
you know, like where all
they talk about was wiring?

421
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:14,329
Freakin' Internet-- find
anything on it these days.

422
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:15,663
What do you say?

423
00:23:15,698 --> 00:23:17,666
Pop over,
have another look-see?

424
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,037
Listen.

425
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:25,141
I think we possibly have
a lead on something.

426
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:26,375
Yeah?

427
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,177
I have this guy
down at the office.

428
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:30,380
He says he has
some kind of information.

429
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:33,015
The thing is,
he'll only give it to you,

430
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,818
in person.

431
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:42,058
Okay.

432
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,560
Remember Hector Salamanca?

433
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:44,828
Sh-- Yeah.

434
00:23:44,862 --> 00:23:46,863
What, you mean the old
cripple guy with the bell?

435
00:23:46,898 --> 00:23:48,599
Rather crap on our floor
than talk to us?

436
00:23:48,633 --> 00:23:50,200
No, I don't remember him
at all. Why?

437
00:23:50,235 --> 00:23:52,803
Well, he's the guy.

438
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,004
His nurse calls us,

439
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:56,774
says he wants to powwow.

440
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:58,409
So we have this guy
at the office

441
00:23:58,444 --> 00:23:59,844
for three hours,

442
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:02,481
and he still just wants
to talk to you.

443
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:06,486
Do not even think
about going down there.

444
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,654
Marie.

445
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:08,921
This is clearly a ploy

446
00:24:08,956 --> 00:24:10,223
or a trick or something

447
00:24:10,257 --> 00:24:12,792
designed to get Hank
out into the open.

448
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,893
That's all this is.

449
00:24:13,927 --> 00:24:15,161
That's what we thought.

450
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:16,529
Well.

451
00:24:16,564 --> 00:24:19,065
It's been years since
this guy's been a player.

452
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,466
His nephew's gone.

453
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,768
Doesn't have anybody.

454
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:24,070
The nurse checks out--
doesn't know nothing.

455
00:24:24,105 --> 00:24:27,307
Guess I just don't see
an angle in it,

456
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,275
if there even is one.

457
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,578
Of course, if you did want
to talk to this guy,

458
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,313
there's not safer place
than the office.

459
00:24:35,448 --> 00:24:37,782
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

460
00:24:37,817 --> 00:24:39,117
Yeah, I agree, Uncle Hank.

461
00:24:39,151 --> 00:24:41,486
It is a ridiculous idea,

462
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,888
and there is no way
you are going to do it,

463
00:24:43,923 --> 00:24:45,223
end of story.

464
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:49,594
Hank, thanks for coming down.

465
00:24:49,629 --> 00:24:52,297
[Hank] No problem at all.
Good to see you, sir.

466
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:05,379
So Mr. Salamanca.

467
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,747
You had something
you want to tell me?

00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:34,283
You know, still saying
it wasn't the ricin.

656
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,254
I don't understand.

657
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:41,223
Then what was it?

658
00:45:41,257 --> 00:45:43,058
Saying it was most likely

659
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:46,228
a flower called
lily of the valley.

660
00:45:47,863 --> 00:45:50,265
Yeah, it's--
it's, like, common.

661
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:52,600
It's got these
red berries on it

662
00:45:52,635 --> 00:45:54,068
that I guess taste sweet,

663
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:55,503
and sometimes
little kids eat them

664
00:45:55,537 --> 00:45:56,837
and wind up poisoning
themselves,

665
00:45:56,872 --> 00:45:58,706
and that's it,

666
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,641
nothing more.

667
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,281
So Gus didn't poison him
after all.

668
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,423
Still, he--

669
00:46:17,159 --> 00:46:20,395
he had to go, right?

670
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,401
You're damn right.

671
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:26,768
Gus had to go.

672
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,944
Um, you know, I should--

673
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:39,813
I should get back.

674
00:46:39,848 --> 00:46:41,181
Andrea's waiting.

675
00:47:26,265 --> 00:47:28,733

676
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:32,071
<i>I'm here at Casa Tranquila,</i> <i>where three
people are dead</i> <i>following an explosion</i>

677

[phone ringing]

679
00:47:36,844 --> 00:47:38,845
<i>The fireball completely</i>

<i>nearby.</i>

681
00:47:40,081 --> 00:47:41,348
Walt?
<i>[Newscaster continues]</i>

682
00:47:41,382 --> 00:47:42,716
- Tell Dad to turn on his TV.
- Shh.

683
00:47:42,751 --> 00:47:43,884
Walt, let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

684
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:45,953
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Shh.

685
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:47,388
Walt?

686
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,556
<i>[Walt]</i> <i>How are you doing?</i>

687
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:50,658
How am I doing?
How are you doing?

688
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,593
I'm, uh...

689
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:56,797
I'm doing quite well.

690
00:47:58,132 --> 00:48:01,001
[sighs] I'm good.

691
00:48:01,035 --> 00:48:03,770
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

692
00:48:03,804 --> 00:48:05,305
Gus Fring is dead.

693
00:48:05,339 --> 00:48:07,440
<i>He was blown up along</i>
<i>with some person</i>

694
00:48:07,474 --> 00:48:09,743
<i>from some Mexican cartel,</i>

695
00:48:09,777 --> 00:48:12,346
<i>and the DEA has no idea</i>
<i>what to make of it.</i>

696
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,482
Do you know about this?

697
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,252
<i>Walt?</i> <i>I need you to--</i>

698
00:48:18,287 --> 00:48:20,088
It's over.

699
00:48:20,122 --> 00:48:21,489
We're safe.

700
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:24,426
<i>[Newscaster continuing]</i>
[heavy breathing]

701
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:36,971
Was this you?

702
00:48:39,908 --> 00:48:41,575
<i>What happened?</i>

703
00:48:43,411 --> 00:48:45,111
I won.

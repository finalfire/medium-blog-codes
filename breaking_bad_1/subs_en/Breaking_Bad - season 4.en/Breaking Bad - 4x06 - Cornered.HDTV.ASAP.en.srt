00:00:05,859 --> 00:00:07,777
Are you in danger?

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,465
This is it, right?
Last stop?

4
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:15,199
It's like you wanted.
The kid's a hero.

5
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:18,076
It's a story people would believe.
This is what we buy.

6
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:21,361
To clean cars and clean money.

7
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:24,315
Gale Boetticher he
was a genius.

8
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:26,523
- I'm not sure I agree.
- What do you mean?

9
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:29,816
This genius of yours
maybe is still out there.

10
00:01:18,968 --> 00:01:20,034
No, no, no!

11
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,361
Hey. Chh-chh.

Oh...

23
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:49,197
Mmm.

24
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:54,636
Ohh...

25
00:04:54,671 --> 00:04:56,538
Morning.

26
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:58,707
Afternoon.

27
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:01,776
Oh. Really? Jesus.

28
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,347
You shouldn't
have let me sleep.

29
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,082
You needed it.

30
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:13,255
Ohh...

31
00:05:19,797 --> 00:05:22,232
Skyler, I don't
entirely remember

32
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:23,534
what happened last night.

33
00:05:23,568 --> 00:05:24,936
I mean, if...

34
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,337
I said something--

35
00:05:26,372 --> 00:05:28,873
Did you know
this Gale Boetticher person?

36
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:33,245
Skyler, I can't even
focus. I don't--

37
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,347
Gale Boetticher.

38
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,115
Did you know him?

39
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,150
Ha.

40
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,451
Oh, my God. What?

41
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:43,321
What exactly
did I say last night?

42
00:05:43,355 --> 00:05:45,990
Just enough.

43
00:05:46,024 --> 00:05:48,258
Did you work together?

44
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:56,466
Who killed him?

45
00:05:57,734 --> 00:06:00,536
Was it the people you work for?

46
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,773
Definitely not.

47
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,308
Was it somebody who--

48
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:09,045
At one point...

49
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,149
might want to do
the same to you?

50
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:17,554
I seriously doubt it.

51
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:18,622
No.

52
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:22,726
Ohh...

53
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,027
God.

54
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,333
Oh, God.

55
00:06:36,007 --> 00:06:39,442
I think I know what happened
last night, Walt.

56
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:42,545
Mm. I know exactly
what happened last night.

57
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,847
I drank too much wine.

58
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,484
You told Hank

59
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:50,087
that the man he was looking for

60
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,354
might still be out there,

61
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:52,823
that it might not be this--

62
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:53,958
Mm.

63
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:55,626
Boetticher after all.

64
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:59,197
And I was up all night

65
00:06:59,232 --> 00:07:02,268
wondering why you would
say that to him.

66
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,770
Because I was drunk, Skyler.

67
00:07:03,804 --> 00:07:04,904
No, but then--

68
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,072
But then I was remembering

69
00:07:06,107 --> 00:07:07,741
your black eye--

70
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,911
Your, uh, business disagreement

71
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,312
that you don't
want to talk about.

72
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:16,250
I don't want to talk
about any of this ever.

73
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:18,820
The firewall, all right?

74
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,788
Church and state.

75
00:07:20,822 --> 00:07:23,624
That's how we need
to approach this thing.

76
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:28,362
And then I remembered
the message

77
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:29,964
you left me the other day...

78
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,467
when you said you loved me.

79
00:07:36,971 --> 00:07:39,605
When I heard that,
I thought that maybe...

80
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,873
you-- I don't know--

81
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:44,810
That you were regretting
what's happened between us,

82
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,244
and I get that.

83
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:48,380
After last night, I--

84
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:55,753
Walt, I think you're scared.

85
00:07:56,789 --> 00:07:59,391
I think that message
was some...

86
00:07:59,425 --> 00:08:01,126
kind of goodbye.

87
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,260
Oh, Skyler.

88
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,362
I think last night
was a cry for help.

89
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:05,697
Oh, Jesus.

90
00:08:05,732 --> 00:08:07,266
Cry for help.

91
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,269
I think some part of you
wants Hank to catch you.

92
00:08:10,303 --> 00:08:12,438
Wow!

93
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:14,774
That is just--

94
00:08:14,808 --> 00:08:16,042
That is--

95
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:18,144
That is it.

96
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,213
Exactly, yes.

97
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:22,515
You're like
Dr. Joyce Brothers here.

98
00:08:22,549 --> 00:08:23,883
God!

99
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,118
If he caught you,

100
00:08:25,152 --> 00:08:26,586
at least this would
all be over.

101
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:28,455
Oh, yeah. That's
a tremendous weight

102
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,456
just lifted off of me.

103
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:32,891
Now I--
I understand myself.

104
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,626
Thank you. Thank you.

105
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,961
Walt.

106
00:08:35,996 --> 00:08:37,563
I've said it before.

107
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:41,200
If you are in danger,
we go to the police.

108
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:43,336
Oh, no. I don't want to
hear about the police.

109
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,405
I do not say that lightly.

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,008
I know what it could do
to this family.

111
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:51,677
But if it's the only
real choice we have--

112
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,212
If it's either that--
Oh...

113
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,280
or your getting shot
when you open your front door--

114
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:56,949
I don't want to hear
about the police.

115
00:08:56,983 --> 00:08:59,518
You're not some
hardened criminal, Walt.

116
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,520
You're in over your head.

117
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:03,355
That's what we tell them.
That's the truth.

118
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,622
That is not the truth.

119
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:06,191
Of course it is.

120
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:09,693
A schoolteacher, cancer,
desperate for money?

121
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:10,661
Okay, we're done here.

122
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:11,729
Roped into working for--

123
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:12,896
Unable to even quit?

124
00:09:12,931 --> 00:09:15,332
You told me that
yourself, Walt.

125
00:09:15,366 --> 00:09:17,901
Jesus, what was I thinking?

126
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,402
Walt, please.

127
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:21,037
Let's both of us

128
00:09:21,072 --> 00:09:23,373
stop trying to justify
this whole thing

129
00:09:23,407 --> 00:09:25,808
and admit you're in danger.

130
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:29,712
Who are you talking to
right now?

131
00:09:32,315 --> 00:09:34,550
Who is it you think you see?

132
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:39,722
Do you know how much
I make a year?

133
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:42,426
I mean, even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

134
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,827
Do you know what would happen

135
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:46,364
if I suddenly decided
to stop going in to work?

136
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:48,299
A business big enough

137
00:09:48,334 --> 00:09:49,701
that it could be listed
on the NASDAQ

138
00:09:49,735 --> 00:09:52,103
goes belly-up, disappears.

139
00:09:52,137 --> 00:09:54,939
It ceases to exist
without me. No.

140
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:57,909
You clearly don't know
who you're talking to,

141
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,077
so let me clue you in.

142
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:01,779
I am not in danger, Skyler.

143
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,381
I am the danger.

144
00:10:03,415 --> 00:10:05,216
A guy opens his door
and gets shot,

145
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,616
and you think that of me?

146
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:07,717
No.

147
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:10,086
I am the one who knocks.

148
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,679
Ohh...

149
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,595
Look, I was--

150
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,244
Skyler?

151
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,467
Here we are.

152
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,335
Just like you left it.

153
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:39,008
And where is your pretty wife?

154
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:43,180
She has other business
to attend to.

155
00:11:43,214 --> 00:11:45,883
Well, like I say to her,

156
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:49,487
place is as is.
Understand?

157
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,824
Yes, I understand.

158
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:54,826
Good. Good.

159
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,495
I don't want her coming back
with more demands.

160
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:00,631
She-- She gave me hard time
when we settled on price.

161
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,334
We're all on
the same page, Bogdan.

162
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,138
So here's everything you need.

163
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:09,672
I keep very good files.

164
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,641
Thank you.

165
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:14,310
So you are the boss now, huh?

166
00:12:18,349 --> 00:12:19,916
You think you're ready?

167
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,388
Yes, I-- I think so.

168
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:29,559
Being boss is tough.

169
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:33,597
I know you think
I was hard on you,

170
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:35,566
but you'll learn.

171
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,169
Being in charge is not easy.

172
00:12:39,204 --> 00:12:40,937
It takes hard work.

173
00:12:40,971 --> 00:12:43,106
You've seen me work hard,
Bogdan.

174
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,543
Yeah? I don't know.

175
00:12:46,577 --> 00:12:48,511
Not so much, maybe.

176
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:51,114
But maybe,
when you are the boss,

177
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,850
uh, you will
just keep your feet up

178
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,519
and relax.

179
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:57,520
Mm.

180
00:12:57,554 --> 00:13:00,990
The real important thing,

181
00:13:01,025 --> 00:13:03,460
and not everyone knows this is,

182
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:05,228
is to be tough.

183
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:11,134
A boss has to be tough.

184
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:14,404
Has to say no to people.

185
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:20,778
Has to make cashiers
wipe down cars,

186
00:13:20,812 --> 00:13:24,315
even if they don't want to.

187
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:29,354
Can you be tough, Walter?

188
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,794
I-- I'm sure
you can handle.

189
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:37,696
And if not,

190
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:41,266
you can always
call your wife, huh?

191
00:13:48,774 --> 00:13:51,742
Always sticky. No problem.

192
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,281
As is.

193
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,366
Who'd have thought

194
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,970
that someday I would be
handing these keys to you?

195
00:14:31,886 --> 00:14:35,088
Many years. Almost forgot.

196
00:14:40,663 --> 00:14:41,896
Bogdan.

197
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:47,469
As is.

198
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:02,492
Thank you.

199
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:39,962
You okay there?

200
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,365
Fine.

201
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:49,137
It's night.
I'm not using.

202
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,948
Eat something.

203
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,450
Yeah.

204
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:39,221
That's right.
Both of them.

205
00:17:40,556 --> 00:17:41,556
Uh--

206
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,625
I'm on my way.

207
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:48,629
You need any help?

208
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
No.

209
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:15,188
You want me to call her back?

210
00:18:15,223 --> 00:18:17,624
No. No.

211
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,463
But what exactly did she say?

212
00:18:22,497 --> 00:18:24,565
Uh, exactly.

213
00:18:25,634 --> 00:18:27,234
Just, you know,

214
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:30,738
she asked if I was okay
and not to worry.

215
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:32,940
Like that.

216
00:18:32,974 --> 00:18:34,175
Hmm.

217
00:18:34,209 --> 00:18:37,812
Any, uh, rough timetable
on this thing,

218
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:40,382
or as to when she's
coming home?

219
00:18:42,252 --> 00:18:45,221
Uh, it's-- It's about
the gambling, right?

220
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,260
Well, it's--
It's kind of hard to--

221
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,062
She-- She can't understand.

222
00:18:53,096 --> 00:18:55,831
It-- It-- It's not like you're
doing this on purpose.

223
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:57,133
You can't help it.

224
00:18:58,835 --> 00:19:00,870
It's no that simple.

225
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:02,572
Look, you have a disease.

226
00:19:02,606 --> 00:19:06,409
It-- It's like you're
an alcoholic, right?

227
00:19:06,443 --> 00:19:08,210
No, it's not. Not at all.

228
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,712
Yes, it is.
I read online.

229
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:12,948
She's not even allowed
to be mad at you,

230
00:19:12,982 --> 00:19:15,817
and she can't be mad at you
about the cancer, can she?

231
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:18,620
No, son, these are two
very different things.

232
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:22,056
Not really. Gambling
addiction is a sickness.

233
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:23,391
- You c--
- Listen.

234
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:26,394
What is going on with me
is not about some disease.

235
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:27,529
It's about choices--

236
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:29,431
Choices that I have made,

237
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:32,301
choices I stand by.

238
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:44,248
You're not moving
back in, are you?

239
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:53,023
No.

240
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:00,329
Hey.

241
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:02,197
You know what?

242
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:04,332
School can wait.

243
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:08,470
Why don't we
take a little detour?

244
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:11,807
What kind of detour?

245
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,744
You'll see.

246
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:29,294
I think it's time
we got you your own car.

247
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,562
What do you think?

248
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,331
What?

249
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:38,604
I-- I think if you're
going to buy me off...

250
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,540
buy me off.

251
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,132
Wow.

252
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,901
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

253
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,736
Ah, it's good-looking.

254
00:21:13,274 --> 00:21:14,174
I'm glad you like it.

255
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,009
I-- I do, Thank you, Dad.

256
00:21:16,043 --> 00:21:17,344
All right.
You're welcome.

257
00:21:34,662 --> 00:21:36,063
So you're here.

258
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:37,965
Yeah.

259
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,072
You're actually here?
To work?

260
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:46,774
Yeah, man.

261
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,242
Jesus.

262
00:21:48,276 --> 00:21:49,276
Jesse.

263
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,580
Come here.

264
00:21:52,614 --> 00:21:54,782
All right, I need an update.

265
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,850
Update on what?

266
00:21:55,884 --> 00:21:58,519
An update on these
little field trips

267
00:21:58,553 --> 00:22:00,354
that you've been
taking with Mike.

268
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:02,957
I told you already.
We pick up money,

269
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:04,725
check on things,
stuff like that.

270
00:22:06,194 --> 00:22:07,895
And you're his bodyguard,
right?

271
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:11,265
But what?
That's what you said.

272
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:14,502
I said I guarded him,
like backup,

273
00:22:14,536 --> 00:22:15,770
like a second set of eyes.

274
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:17,772
Everybody needs backup, right?

275
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:20,675
And this has to be you.

276
00:22:20,709 --> 00:22:23,210
It can't be...
I don't know.

277
00:22:23,245 --> 00:22:26,681
Tyrus or any of those
couple dozen muscle heads

278
00:22:26,716 --> 00:22:28,282
that Gus has working for him?

279
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:30,652
It has to be Jesse Pinkman.

280
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:32,020
Why?

281
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,655
What is there,
something about you

282
00:22:33,689 --> 00:22:34,889
that I don't know?

283
00:22:34,923 --> 00:22:37,158
Are you a former Navy SEAL?

284
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:38,626
Do you have to have your hands

285
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,894
registered as lethal weapons?

286
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:41,295
Register this.

287
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:44,799
All I'm saying is that do you
not even question this?

288
00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,233
Do you really believe

289
00:22:46,268 --> 00:22:48,402
that you mean anything
to these people?

290
00:22:48,437 --> 00:22:49,870
And I'm not trying
to be insulting.

291
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:51,738
I'm just trying to make you
see things clearly.

292
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:54,008
I see they can't
outright kill me,

293
00:22:54,042 --> 00:22:55,476
but they don't want me
getting high.

294
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,279
I see this
thing probably started

295
00:22:58,313 --> 00:23:00,147
as Gus getting Mike
to babysit me.

296
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:02,083
But you know what?

297
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:05,119
I saved Mike
from getting robbed,

298
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,388
even killed, maybe.

299
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:10,758
So maybe I'm not
such a loser after all.

300
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:14,996
I mean, what if it--

301
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,464
Oh, God.

302
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:26,707
I mean, what if--

303
00:23:26,742 --> 00:23:29,010
What if it's all just a setup?

304
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:32,079
- What? - What if this
robbery that you stopped

305
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,514
wasn't even real?

306
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:35,282
I mean, think about it.

307
00:23:35,316 --> 00:23:37,417
Your first day out
guarding Mike.

308
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,853
He steps out for one second,
and what happens?

309
00:23:39,887 --> 00:23:41,521
You immediately get robbed.

310
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:42,956
You are such an asshole.

311
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,558
Keep your friends close,
keep your enemies closer.

312
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:46,826
Like you said,

313
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,129
Gus can't kill you
because of me.

314
00:23:49,163 --> 00:23:50,597
He knows I won't stand for it.

315
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:53,066
He needs me, and he hates
the fact that he needs me,

316
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,767
so what does he do?
He goes to work

317
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:56,536
driving a wedge
between you and me.

318
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,604
You're an asshole.

319
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:58,772
If you'd been there,

320
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,073
you'd know it wasn't a setup.

321
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:02,142
Wait a minute. How long
did those guys chase you?

322
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,644
Huh? Because the way
you describe it,

323
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,280
they gave up pretty damn easy.

324
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:09,282
No, no. This--

325
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:12,318
This whole thing,
all of this--

326
00:24:14,054 --> 00:24:16,321
It's all about me.

327
00:25:03,467 --> 00:25:04,468
Hello.

328
00:25:07,104 --> 00:25:09,206
Uh, who is it? Hang on.

329
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:16,047
Yeah.

330
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:17,849
I'll be right up.

331
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,520
What?

332
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,723
I got to go.

333
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:26,325
Well, am I supposed to
clean all this on my own?

334
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,163
Hey!

335
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,835
God.

336
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,588
Ah.

337
00:25:56,623 --> 00:25:58,724
<i>Buenos días,</i> ladies.

338
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,027
<i>Buenos días.</i>
Uh, do you speak English?

339
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,562
<i>¿Se habla inglés?</i> No. No.

340
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:03,863
No. Okay, uh...

341
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:05,431
<i>yo-- Yo,</i> uh--

00:26:05,466 --> 00:26:07,433

Uh, ayon-- Ayonda--

344
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:11,337
<i>Ayuda.</i> <i>Ayuda, ayuda.

00:26:11,371 --> 00:26:15,607
Uh, <i>yo necesita--</i>
<i>Necesito ayuda a limpio.</i>

347
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,243
<i>¿Qué?</i>
I need help to clean.

348
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,978
Yes, <i>sí, ¿comprendes, sí?</i>

349
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:21,979
<i>¿Qué?</i>

350
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,280
No, no, no. <i>Es bueno.</i>

351
00:26:23,314 --> 00:26:25,515
Uh... Uh, <i>por favor,</i>
<i>por favor.</i>

352
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,050
<i>Atrás, atrás, ¿sí?</i>

353
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:29,019
<i>Muy bueno, muy bueno.</i>

354
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:34,057
Yes, <i>muy bueno.</i>

355
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,459
- It's just this--
- No.

356
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,160
No, no, no, no.
<i>No podemos.</i>

357
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,161
<i>No podemos.</i>

358
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:39,162
<i>Lo siento.</i>

359
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,798
No, no, no, no.
<i>Es no problema.</i>

360
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,399
<i>Un momento, un momento,</i>
<i>un momento.</i>

361
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:43,400
<i>No problema.</i>

362
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:49,573
No, no, ladies.

363
00:26:49,607 --> 00:26:50,741
<i>Un momento, un momento.</i>

364
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,209
<i>Un momento, un momento.</i>

365
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,712
<i>Yo necesito ayuda,</i> uh...

00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:00,484
<i>No, no podemos.</i>
<i>Muy fácil.</i>

368
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,821
Let me see. Let me see.
<i>Un momento.</i>

369
00:27:03,855 --> 00:27:05,523
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

370
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:06,691
Look, look, look.

371
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,860
Universal language.
<i>Dinero. ¿Dinero?</i>

372
00:27:08,894 --> 00:27:10,729
No.
<i>¿Para usted?</i>

373
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:11,897
<i>Sí, sí, sí.</i>

374
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:13,466
<i>Para usted, sí.</i>
<i>Para usted.</i>

375
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,601
There's one for you.
Yes, <i>sí.</i>

376
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:18,405
<i>Presidente</i> Grant.
Very important man.

377
00:27:18,439 --> 00:27:21,975
<i>Sí. Para usted, sí, sí.</i>

378
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:23,410
And <i>más dinero--</i>

379
00:27:23,444 --> 00:27:25,078
<i>Más dinero</i> after--

380
00:27:29,083 --> 00:27:30,450
Are we good?

381
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:31,517
I think we're good.

382
00:27:31,552 --> 00:27:32,585
I think we listened to you.

383
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,986
Please. <i>Por favor.</i>
<i>Por favor.</i>

384
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:34,987
<i>Vamos.</i>

385
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,490
<i>Dos horas máximo, ¿sí?</i>

386
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,291
Please. <i>Por favor.</i>
<i>Por favor.</i>

387
00:27:40,293 --> 00:27:41,260
Yes.

388
00:27:41,294 --> 00:27:43,529
<i>Iguales!</i>

389
00:30:21,175 --> 00:30:22,408
What's the deal?

390
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:29,416
Uh, the deal is we're
watching that house.

391
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:33,087
A couple down on the left
with the tree in the front.

392
00:30:33,121 --> 00:30:35,390
Yeah? What for?

393
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:38,226
A little birdie told me
there's some guys in there

394
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,961
that have 3 pounds
of our product

395
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:41,330
which they're selling

396
00:30:41,364 --> 00:30:44,233
and which they sure as hell
didn't get from us.

397
00:30:45,869 --> 00:30:48,304
So what's the plan?

398
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,540
I just told you.

399
00:30:51,575 --> 00:30:54,443
We sit here
and watch that house

400
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:57,480
until one of our entrepreneurs
pops his head out.

401
00:30:57,514 --> 00:30:58,948
Then we ask a few questions

402
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,816
and get our property back.

403
00:31:02,419 --> 00:31:05,354
Why don't you just go
break the door down

404
00:31:05,388 --> 00:31:08,323
and pistol whip those bitches
and show them who's boss?

405
00:31:08,357 --> 00:31:11,393
Because a little birdie
also told me

406
00:31:11,427 --> 00:31:13,461
these guys are heavily
into the product

407
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:15,530
and most likely armed.

408
00:31:15,564 --> 00:31:18,832
Now, what you may not
know about meth heads--

409
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,468
Maybe you do--

410
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:24,238
They're kind of unpredictable.

411
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:26,340
I don't care for unpredictable,

412
00:31:26,374 --> 00:31:27,808
so we wait.

413
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,780
Sorry to burst
your bubble, kid,

414
00:31:31,814 --> 00:31:34,316
but that's 90% of the job.

415
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,752
Don't worry.

416
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,887
I brought sandwiches.

417
00:31:42,158 --> 00:31:44,760
Yes, sir. Ha.

418
00:31:44,794 --> 00:31:47,730
Uh...

419
00:31:47,764 --> 00:31:50,566
pimiento cheese.
How does that sound?

420
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:00,009
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

421
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,510
So they're selling, right?

422
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,612
Maybe I'm looking to buy.

423
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,287
Who the hell are you?

424
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,488
Tucker!

425
00:32:14,522 --> 00:32:15,822
I'm, uh, here to buy.

426
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:17,290
Tucker! Will you
shut the damn door?

427
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:18,325
- Not my question.
- Tucker!

428
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,492
Uh, my name's Diesel.

429
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:20,660
Tucker!

430
00:32:20,695 --> 00:32:22,629
Thought you maybe had
some of the blue?

431
00:32:22,663 --> 00:32:24,697
Tucker!
Shut the door, Tucker!

432
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:25,765
- I'm just, uh--
- Tucker!

433
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,200
Just looking for a teenth.

434
00:32:27,234 --> 00:32:29,336
- Tucker!
- Yo. Come on.

435
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,570
- Tucker!
- Help a brother out.

436
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:32,272
Tucker, will you
shut the damn door?

437
00:32:32,306 --> 00:32:34,240
We don't sell to strangers.

438
00:32:34,274 --> 00:32:35,374
Tucker!

439
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:36,842
Get off the porch, asshole.

440
00:32:36,877 --> 00:32:38,310
Tucker, will you shut the door?

441
00:32:38,345 --> 00:32:39,778
All right already!
Jesus!

442
00:32:39,813 --> 00:32:40,913
Tucker!

443
00:33:14,315 --> 00:33:16,817
Guess we'll go
with Plan A, then.

444
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:33,732
Flip the trunk, will you?

445
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:35,901
Why?

446
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:37,935
There's something
in there I need.

447
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:39,537
And what would that be?

448
00:33:39,571 --> 00:33:42,340
I'm getting those pricks
out of that house.

449
00:33:42,374 --> 00:33:45,209
Oh, your first attempt
being such a wild success.

450
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:48,814
You may know this whole
P.I. sit-in-the-car business,

451
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:50,783
but I know meth heads.

452
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,137
What are you doing?

453
00:34:45,606 --> 00:34:46,806
Digging.

454
00:34:47,908 --> 00:34:49,342
Why?

455
00:34:50,611 --> 00:34:52,712
Uh, you know why.

456
00:34:52,747 --> 00:34:55,014
How deep are you going?

457
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,449
I don't know.

458
00:34:56,483 --> 00:34:59,018
How deep do you think it is?

459
00:35:02,623 --> 00:35:03,790
Pretty deep.

460
00:35:11,065 --> 00:35:12,166
Hey, uh...

461
00:35:13,435 --> 00:35:16,537
you mind taking over
for a minute?

462
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,307
Yeah. Sure.

463
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:33,021
Hey, uh, mind if I
use your john?

464
00:35:33,056 --> 00:35:34,123
Yeah.

465
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:02,118
Tucker!

466
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:05,855
Tucker!

467
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:12,862
Tucker!

468
00:36:18,502 --> 00:36:20,604
Who the hell are you?

469
00:36:20,638 --> 00:36:22,138
I-- Hey.

470
00:36:22,172 --> 00:36:23,206
Who the hell are you?

471
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,640
Hey, I'm, uh--

472
00:36:24,675 --> 00:36:26,009
I'm a friend of Tucker's.

473
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,410
What do you want?

474
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:28,878
I just, uh--

475
00:36:28,912 --> 00:36:31,881
Just want to-- Just want
to buy some of the blue.

476
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:33,216
It's not for sale.

477
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,887
Well, I know you were
selling it earlier, so--

478
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:39,523
Yeah?
How do you know that?

479
00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:41,424
Uh, Tucker told me.

480
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:43,293
Yeah, well,
Tucker needs to learn

481
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:45,094
to keep his damn mouth shut.

482
00:36:45,129 --> 00:36:46,262
Tucker!

483
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,430
Tucker?

484
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,000
So, uh...

485
00:36:51,035 --> 00:36:52,568
you going to help me out?

486
00:36:52,603 --> 00:36:54,937
Don't have enough for all
of Tucker's asshole friends.

487
00:36:54,971 --> 00:36:57,172
Tucker!

488
00:36:57,207 --> 00:36:59,474
Yo, I-- I think he's outside.

489
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,475
Why don't you just--

490
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,710
Why don't you go outside--

491
00:37:01,744 --> 00:37:03,344
Tucker! Tucker!

492
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:06,914
Hey, hey. Let's go--
Let's go find Tucker.

493
00:37:06,949 --> 00:37:09,184
Okay?
Let's go outside and--

494
00:37:09,218 --> 00:37:13,622
I don't have enough
for you, all right?

495
00:37:13,657 --> 00:37:16,458
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:37:16,493 --> 00:37:18,727
Forget it. Okay?

497
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,129
I don't want to--

498
00:37:20,163 --> 00:37:21,130
I don't want to start
any trouble.

499
00:37:21,164 --> 00:37:22,531
Trouble? Trouble?

500
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:23,799
What does that mean, trouble?

501
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,068
No, no. I'm just saying
we're cool, okay?

502
00:37:26,103 --> 00:37:27,303
We're-- We're-- We're good.

503
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:29,305
What? You can't know that.

504
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,507
What does that mean?

505
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,009
What-- Don't put thoughts
in my head!

506
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,978
You don't put
thoughts in my head!

507
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:36,280
Absolutely. You're right.

508
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:37,348
You're right.

509
00:37:37,382 --> 00:37:38,516
Tucker.

510
00:37:43,721 --> 00:37:44,822
You--

511
00:38:14,068 --> 00:38:15,168
Uh...

512
00:38:15,202 --> 00:38:17,937
<i>muchas,</i> <i>muchas gracias, amigas.</i>

513
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:20,139
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>
Here you go.

514
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,340
Oh, <i>gracias.</i>

515
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:23,676
María, Vernita, Lucía, <i>gracias.</i>

516
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,244
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

517
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:26,711
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

518
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:29,648
<i>Ustedes,</i> uh, residar
<i>¿cerca aquí?</i>

519
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:34,886
I missed that one.
I'm sure it was good.

520
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,724
<i>Damas. Vengan conmigo.</i>

521
00:38:45,399 --> 00:38:48,468
Uh, what-- Wait a minute.
Where are you taking them?

522
00:38:48,502 --> 00:38:50,603
Come on, Tyrus,
what are you doing?

523
00:38:50,638 --> 00:38:52,705
I'm putting them on a bus.

524
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,474
Why? What bus?

525
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,008
One that takes them
back to Honduras.

526
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,943
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a minute.

527
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:02,413
Th-Th-This was my idea.

528
00:39:02,448 --> 00:39:03,781
Don't punish them.

529
00:39:03,816 --> 00:39:06,550
You tell Gus
to blame me, not them.

530
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:08,419
He does.

531
00:39:33,479 --> 00:39:34,913
Give us a minute, will you?

532
00:39:47,528 --> 00:39:48,929
We won't be too long.

533
00:39:57,572 --> 00:40:00,373
The crew that hit our truck
gave away the cargo

534
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:02,608
to a couple of local nobodies.

535
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:04,076
Very disciplined, though,

536
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:06,312
not keeping anything
for themselves.

537
00:40:06,346 --> 00:40:09,648
It was all about
sending a message,

538
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:11,950
which they did, literally.

539
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:15,388
It was written
on the bucket lid.

540
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:17,323
"Ready to talk?"

541
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:20,494
That, I believe,
is the English translation.

542
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:27,169
I know you're not really
asking for advice,

543
00:40:27,203 --> 00:40:33,076
but let me hire 10,
15 more good operators,

544
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,078
and we hit them back,
hit them hard,

545
00:40:35,112 --> 00:40:36,146
hit them where they live.

546
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,047
No.

547
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,950
This war stays cold for now.

548
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,791
What about their message?
What's the answer?

549
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:52,963
Set up a meeting.

550
00:40:52,997 --> 00:40:55,065
Let's see
what they have to say.

551
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,703
How did he do today?

552
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,928
I hear you can handle yourself.

553
00:41:25,363 --> 00:41:26,563
I guess.

554
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:29,833
Good night.

555
00:41:29,867 --> 00:41:31,701
Uh, excuse me.

556
00:41:34,038 --> 00:41:35,906
Why me?

557
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:40,110
I like to think
I see things in people.

558
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:09,937
Slow down. The car
is not going anywhere.

559
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:14,776
Mom.

560
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:17,045
Hey, sweetheart.

561
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,213
Hi.

562
00:42:18,247 --> 00:42:19,281
Hey.

563
00:42:21,317 --> 00:42:24,186
Whoo. Ah.
There you go.

564
00:42:24,221 --> 00:42:26,189
Did you see
what's in the driveway?

565
00:42:26,224 --> 00:42:29,393
Uh, yeah, I saw.

566
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,461
Hey.

567
00:42:33,899 --> 00:42:35,900
So that's yours, huh?

568
00:42:35,935 --> 00:42:38,803
Yeah.
Dad got it for me.

569
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:41,106
That was very nice of him.

570
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,041
Yeah.

571
00:42:43,076 --> 00:42:46,645
I-- I know it looks like...

572
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,616
well, awesome,
but it's super safe.

573
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,951
Dad-- Dad made sure.

574
00:42:51,985 --> 00:42:54,420
And I promise to always
go the speed limit

575
00:42:54,454 --> 00:42:56,789
or below, way below.

576
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,828
And it gets great gas mileage.

577
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:06,467
So Dad said I can take it
around the block a few times.

578
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:07,669
That okay?

579
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:10,305
Just around the block.

580
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:13,775
Yeah.
Just around the block.

581
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:15,977
And be careful, okay?

582
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:17,011
I will.

583
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:19,347
Bye.

584
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:24,251
I-It-- It's really--

585
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:26,286
It's really great
to have you home, Mom.

586
00:43:33,493 --> 00:43:36,362
Hey, seriously,
be careful, okay?

587
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:37,363
I will.

588
00:43:37,397 --> 00:43:38,397
Okay.

589
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:58,986
I guess we should talk.

590
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,689
Oh, I think you said
plenty the other day.

591
00:44:01,724 --> 00:44:06,428
No. Look, about that,
it just--

592
00:44:06,463 --> 00:44:09,232
Did you get the car wash keys?

593
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:12,035
Um, yes, yes.

594
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:23,746
Skyler, I may have...

595
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,515
overstated things earlier,

596
00:44:26,549 --> 00:44:30,285
and I'm sorry to be so forward.

597
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,654
But I-- I just--

598
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:35,556
I want you to know something.

599
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:36,924
I want you to--

600
00:44:36,959 --> 00:44:40,261
I need you to understand

601
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:42,396
that you are safe.

602
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:45,199
You, Junior, Holly--

603
00:44:45,233 --> 00:44:47,601
You are completely safe.

604
00:44:49,537 --> 00:44:53,073
Everything that I do--
Everything--

605
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:56,610
I do it to protect this family.

606
00:44:57,845 --> 00:45:00,114
So buying that car,

607
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:02,416
that was protecting
your family?

608
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:08,189
Okay. I, uh--

609
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,657
All right, maybe
it's a little flashy,

610
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:12,160
but he needed a car,
and--

611
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:15,096
And I'm his father,

612
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:17,531
and I should be able
to get what he wants.

613
00:45:20,836 --> 00:45:25,038
It goes back tomorrow.

614
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:27,974
Skyler, it will crush him.

615
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:33,780
That car directly
contradicts our story.

616
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:37,516
And if you're so invested
in protecting this family,

617
00:45:37,551 --> 00:45:40,520
it means protecting the story.

618
00:45:40,554 --> 00:45:43,556
What do you think the neighbors
are going to say, Walt?

619
00:45:43,591 --> 00:45:45,325
What about Hank and Marie?

620
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:47,093
How about the IRS?

621
00:45:47,128 --> 00:45:49,429
What were you thinking, Walt?

622
00:45:49,464 --> 00:45:50,964
I was thinking

623
00:45:50,999 --> 00:45:53,401
that I wanted to do
something nice for my son.

624
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:04,180
Look.

625
00:46:06,817 --> 00:46:09,753
I just worry that he'll
blame you for this.

626
00:46:13,991 --> 00:46:16,159
Oh, he will.

627
00:46:16,194 --> 00:46:18,996
Once again,
he'll blame his bitch mother

628
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:21,599
for taking away what his
loving father has given him,

629
00:46:21,633 --> 00:46:24,868
so thanks for that.

630
00:46:27,972 --> 00:46:29,672
But you know what, Walt?

631
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:33,175
Someone has to protect
this family

632
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:35,645
from the man
who protects this family.

633
00:46:55,926 --> 00:46:59,000

1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:02,973
<i>Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...</i>

2
00:00:03,079 --> 00:00:05,083
I need you all outside
to do some wipe outs.

3
00:00:05,184 --> 00:00:06,402
Wipe down this!

4
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,378
I heard you broke
new ground today.

5
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:12,847
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes.
Yeah, I guess I broke new ground.

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,016
You worked here four years.
It's a story people would believe.

7
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:17,536
This is what we buy.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,994
Slow down.
Oh God!

9
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:29,180
At the first opportunity
Gus will kill us.

10
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,962
So? How does it look?

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,864
You mean, in do I see it?

12
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:43,467
Yes.

13
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:46,474
Do you see it?

14
00:00:49,413 --> 00:00:51,584
Basically, any lawman
worth his salt's

15
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,118
going to spot that, yeah.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,853
Assuming that's a deal breaker?

17
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,822
Yes.
It's a deal breaker.

18
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:06,434
Well, if stealth is what
you're aspiring to,

19
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:10,170
you best go with something
more compact--

20
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,039
.38 Special,

21
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,374
snub nose.

22
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,442
Got a concealed hammer

23
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:18,977
so it doesn't catch
on your belt when you draw.

24
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,313
Tried and true,
no nonsense about it.

25
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:26,117
Five shots?
Yep.

26
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:28,051
Automatic has how many?

27
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,720
Ten in the mag,
one in the chamber.

28
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:32,388
If you can't get it done
with five,

29
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:33,956
then you're into spraying prey,

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,257
in which case I wouldn't
count on another six

31
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,525
closing the deal.

32
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,129
You load that
with 158 grain hollow points

33
00:01:41,163 --> 00:01:42,831
instead of your standard
wad cutters.

34
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:44,766
It's got plenty
of stopping power.

35
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,005
Can't get more dependable
than a wheel gun.

36
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,909
Here.
Um...

37
00:01:54,012 --> 00:01:55,412
Try it on with this.

38
00:01:58,751 --> 00:02:01,587
That snub,
you'll conceal real nice

39
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,655
if you carry it I-W-B.

40
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,757
Little harder to draw from,

41
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,626
but there's really
no substitute

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,596
if you're intent of fooling
a vigilant eye.

43
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,433
Comes in polymer, too.

44
00:02:12,467 --> 00:02:15,035
I prefer the feel of leather.

45
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:16,904
Old school, I guess.

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,374
Yeah, um...

47
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:23,010
You sure it's on
the correct side?

48
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:24,946
If you're right-handed,
it is.

49
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,647
I don't know, ma--
Are you sure

50
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:29,516
because maybe it'll feel
better on the left side.

51
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,186
General rule--
You don't want to cross draw,

52
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:35,555
not unless
you're going to be sitting,

53
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,358
you know, store clerks,
card gamers and such.

54
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,236
Either way you're going to want
to practice your draw...

55
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,638
a lot...

56
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,906
because if you're all fingers,

57
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,842
well, it might could be him

58
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,209
keeping a piece instead of you.

59
00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,544
Catch my drift?

60
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,650
What's this?

61
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,486
That there is why
you're going to pay me

62
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,956
five times what you'd pay
your neighborhood gun store.

63
00:03:12,927 --> 00:03:14,928
Serial number
has been filed off.

64
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,566
So...

65
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:21,101
to state the obvious,

66
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,904
I don't want to be
caught with this on me.

67
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,506
No, sir, to state
the obvious, you don't.

68
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,609
You know, Mister,
I've been providing my services

69
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,211
for the past 30-odd years.

70
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,679
You'd think in that time

71
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,848
I'd learn better than to ask
a man his business,

72
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,250
especially about one
referred by the lawyer,

73
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:40,619
but I do feel the urge
to ask you,

74
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,288
we strictly talking
defense here?

75
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,727
Yes, absolutely defense.

76
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,097
Why?

77
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:55,102
Because if it's just
personal protection,

78
00:03:55,136 --> 00:03:58,038
aside from a bucket of money,

79
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:02,008
you'd save yourself
a potential felony two-spot

80
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:04,210
for carrying a weapon
with a defaced serial number

81
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,045
if you'd just buy it legally.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,248
Yeah, but...

83
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:10,750
if you did have to use it,

84
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,085
wouldn't it still be better

85
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,853
to use one
that couldn't be traced?

86
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,588
This is the west, boss.

87
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:19,258
New Mexico's
not a retreat jurisdiction.

88
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,727
Man steps to you
bent on doing bodily harm,

89
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,163
you've got every right
to plant your feet

90
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,898
and shoot to kill.

91
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,500
Some call it a moral right,

92
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,702
and I do include myself
within that class.

93
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,705
All this to say

94
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:35,509
I'm happy to take your money,

95
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,913
but if you're not
a convicted felon,

96
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:41,048
you might best be advised

97
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:43,884
to bear your arms within
the confines of the law.

98
00:04:50,425 --> 00:04:51,959
It's for defense.

99
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,434
Defense.

100
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:11,279
I'll take it.

101
00:05:12,058 --> 00:05:15,755

102
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,001
Thanks, Bonnie.

103
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,872
Jesse.

104
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:49,441
What's up, brother?

105
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,478
Dude, it sounds
like an earthquake out there.

106
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah. New sound system.

107
00:07:55,514 --> 00:07:56,714
Whoa!
Check it out.

108
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:59,050
Bodacious subwoofers, yo!

109
00:07:59,085 --> 00:08:00,452
Serious cannons.

110
00:08:00,486 --> 00:08:03,355
18-inchers,
six of them.

111
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:04,422
Aluminum columns

112
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:05,590
so they're really, really like,

113
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,025
uh, sonically neutral.

114
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,460
Tweeters are killers, too.

115
00:08:08,494 --> 00:08:10,862
Dig all them lines
jumping around.

116
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,063
Psychedelic.

117
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,703
Kind of like just want
to stare at them.

118
00:08:18,738 --> 00:08:21,139
Hmm. Yeah, man.

119
00:08:21,174 --> 00:08:23,574
Totally makes me want
to crank old Savage

120
00:08:23,609 --> 00:08:25,444
and blaze one.

121
00:08:25,478 --> 00:08:28,146
It's got, like,
parametric equalization.

122
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,847
Automatically
adjusts the levels

123
00:08:29,882 --> 00:08:32,217
to changes in, like,
air pressure and whatnot.

124
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:35,486
It's a totally digital
vacuum tube amp

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,456
which is by far the best
anti-distortion-wise.

126
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,124
It's 120 decibels
without breaking a sweat.

127
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:44,461
Hold on to your hats, bitches.

128
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:07,047
Hey, man, I saw Andrea
at a meeting yesterday.

129
00:09:07,082 --> 00:09:08,782
She asked about you.

130
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,669
Thanks, man, but, uh...

131
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:29,438
12 steps and all that.

132
00:09:29,472 --> 00:09:31,906
Seriously?

133
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,827
Maybe just a little bump.

134
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,003
Left 4 Dead, yo,

135
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,471
the way them bitches
get all cranial

136
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:08,273
when you cap them in the head.

137
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,274
It's like booyah!

138
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,709
No, no, no, man.

139
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,744
Resident Evil 4
takes it by a long shot.

140
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,579
Aw, please, brother,
you're fronting.

141
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,681
No, man, seriously.

142
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,749
That chick, the one
you got to rescue,

143
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,317
she's smokin', bro,

144
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,921
and then you're, like,
the last undead dude on earth,

145
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,756
so how can you not be
dipping into that?

146
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,625
Talk about inspiring a brother
to kick some zombie ass!

147
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,961
They're trying to eat
your brain, bro.

148
00:10:29,995 --> 00:10:31,729
A dude don't need
no more motivation.

149
00:10:31,763 --> 00:10:33,397
That's a fair point, I guess.

150
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:36,999
Okay. Okay. Okay.

151
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:39,936
Call of Duty, World at War--
Zombie mode.

152
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:41,972
Now, that's the bomb, man.

153
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,140
Think on it, bro.

154
00:10:43,174 --> 00:10:44,742
They're not just zombies.

155
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,477
They're Nazi zombies.

156
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,979
Nazi zombies.

157
00:10:48,013 --> 00:10:50,448
Yeah, man. S.S. Waffen
troopers, too,

158
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,851
which are, like,
the baddest ass Nazis

159
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,486
of the whole Nazi family!

160
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,887
Zombies are dead, man.

161
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:57,055
What difference does it make

162
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,723
what their job was
when they was living?

163
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:00,859
Dude, you are so
historically retarded.

164
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,428
Nazi zombies
don't want to eat you

165
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:05,530
just because they're
craving the protein.

166
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,098
They do it because--

167
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:11,369
They do it because
they hate Americans, man.

168
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:14,505
Talibans--
They're the Talibans

169
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:16,173
of the zombie world.

170
00:11:16,207 --> 00:11:17,307
I played the game, bro.

171
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:18,641
They ain't exactly
fleet of foot.

172
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:21,244
Ohh! I'm saying where's
the challenge?

173
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,279
At least the zombies
in Left 4 Dead

174
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,547
clock a respectable 40.

175
00:11:24,582 --> 00:11:25,949
You got to lead them and shit.

176
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:27,417
Dude, that's because
they're not even zombies!

177
00:11:27,451 --> 00:11:28,718
They're just infected.

178
00:11:28,753 --> 00:11:31,387
They got, like,
this rage virus.

179
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:33,189
Amps them up like they've
been smoking the schwag!

180
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,158
Apples and oranges, bro.

181
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:37,560
Totally unfair
to compare the two.

182
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:42,399
Yo, Jesse,

183
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,401
where do you come out
on all this?

184
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:47,471
Ha ha! Ohh...

185
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,406
Agree, totally.

186
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,088
Did that just happen?

187
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:07,625
Damn, man.

188
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,393
It's quiet.

189
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:14,399
You know what this--
This place needs?

190
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,276
Ohh.

191
00:14:25,248 --> 00:14:26,849
You okay?

192
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:28,751
Fine.

193
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:31,620
Can't you sleep?

194
00:14:31,655 --> 00:14:33,856
Actually, yes, Marie.
This is me sleeping.

195
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,758
What's it look like?

196
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:38,360
Looks like you're
looking at a rock

197
00:14:38,395 --> 00:14:42,331
at...2:24 in the morning.

198
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:44,434
This is not a rock.
This is a mineral,

199
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,303
for, like, the tenth time.

200
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,174
Okay. Got it.

201
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,910
Blue corundum, to be precise.

202
00:14:52,945 --> 00:14:55,247
Blue corundum.
Well, it's very pretty.

203
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:57,883
It's encrusted
with igneous biotite

204
00:14:57,918 --> 00:14:59,251
in a mica schist.

205
00:14:59,286 --> 00:15:00,653
Would you like
some more detail?

206
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,455
Because I can give it to you.

207
00:15:04,224 --> 00:15:06,993
You keep acting like you
give the first shit,

208
00:15:07,027 --> 00:15:09,229
and I'll--
Hank.

209
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:12,399
Found in the Central
Cordillera of Irian Jaya.

210
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,702
Blue corundum.

211
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:22,710
I'm just saying...
it's 2 in the morning.

212
00:15:22,744 --> 00:15:26,313
I'm just...asking if maybe--

213
00:15:26,348 --> 00:15:27,782
You know, when last
I counted, Marie,

214
00:15:27,816 --> 00:15:30,018
there were four bedrooms
in this house.

215
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:38,494
You know, I mean, if I'm keeping
you awake and all that.

216
00:16:19,337 --> 00:16:20,871
<i>You have reached Walter White.</i>

217
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:22,939
<i>At the tone, please
state your name, number,</i>

218
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,207
<i>and the reason for your call.</i>

219
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,675
<i>Thank you.</i>

220
00:16:26,977 --> 00:16:28,978
<i>Walt?</i>

221
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,780
<i>Hello? Walt?</i>

222
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,182
<i>Um, okay, Walt, could you, uh,</i>

223
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:35,684
<i>could you call me back, please?</i>

224
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:39,487
<i>Hank's bills are really
starting to pile up here,</i>

225
00:16:39,522 --> 00:16:41,289
<i>and, uh, in the meantime,</i>

226
00:16:41,323 --> 00:16:43,224
<i>I haven't received a check
from you in quite a while,</i>

227
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,292
<i>so there's that.</i>

228
00:16:44,326 --> 00:16:46,560
<i>Uh, second order of business</i>

229
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,729
<i>is, uh, is the car wash.</i>

230
00:16:48,764 --> 00:16:49,797
Ohh!

231
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:50,831
God!

232
00:16:50,866 --> 00:16:52,133
<i>Take the next step here.</i>

233
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,901
<i>We need to look
into buying this car wash</i>

234
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:54,903
<i>while we still have--</i>

235
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:57,539
Skyler.
What are you doing?

236
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:58,940
What do you mean?

237
00:16:58,975 --> 00:17:03,012
Wait. Are you screening
all my calls?

238
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:04,981
No. No. No. I just--

239
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:07,316
What are you thinking,
leaving a message like that

240
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,551
<i>on my machine?</i>

241
00:17:08,586 --> 00:17:10,320
What are you--
What did I say?

242
00:17:10,355 --> 00:17:13,124
You just left recorded proof

243
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,226
of our intention
to buy a car wash.

244
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,494
Now you think that was wise?

245
00:17:16,528 --> 00:17:19,763
Proof of our what?
What are you talking about?

246
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:23,734
Skyler, we should not even be
mentioning the words "car wash"

247
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:25,602
on the phone at all, period.

248
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:28,772
Walt, it is a car wash,
not a brothel.

249
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:31,608
<i>I mean, if we can't
even say what it is,</i>

250
00:17:31,642 --> 00:17:33,076
why are we buying it at all?

251
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,144
<i>God, look, Skyler,
please, just--</i>

252
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:36,679
Hey, Mom.

253
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:37,947
Hey, hon.

254
00:17:37,981 --> 00:17:40,383
Look, there's some cereal
on the breakfast table.

255
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,187
I'm telling you,

256
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,288
if you're not willing

257
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:46,590
to pull the trigger on this,

258
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:48,892
I am more than happy
to call Goodman myself.

259
00:17:48,927 --> 00:17:52,230
No, no, no, no, no.
I will handle it, okay?

260
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:01,296
I could so use a brain
transplant right now.

261
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:03,665
Hey, uh, I'm going to work.

262
00:19:05,768 --> 00:19:07,035
Wake up, bitch.

263
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,203
Aah!

264
00:19:09,672 --> 00:19:11,406
Damn!

265
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,607
Ohh.

266
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:17,178
You're way too sensitive
about your zone, bro.

267
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:20,815
Ohh. Come on, man.
Clean-up time.

268
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:23,484
Right on. Least we can do.

269
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,721
Hey. The hell with,
uh, with cleaning up.

270
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:31,825
Just go out and get
everybody some breakfast.

271
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:33,693
Stock up on liquor
while you're at it.

272
00:19:33,728 --> 00:19:35,695
Keep this party going.

273
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:37,831
I mean it, yo.

274
00:19:37,865 --> 00:19:39,699
<i>I want this place kicking
harder than a Sensei</i>

275
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,534
when I get back.

276
00:19:41,569 --> 00:19:42,802
All right.

277
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:44,438
You got it, bro.

278
00:19:53,782 --> 00:19:55,683
Come on, damn it.

279
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:57,752
Wake up and party!

280
00:21:29,945 --> 00:21:31,479
Hmm.

281
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:32,780
Hello.

282
00:21:34,183 --> 00:21:35,651
Yo, you the new guy?

283
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:36,952
Yeah.

284
00:21:36,986 --> 00:21:38,754
You got something for me?

285
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:42,458
201.6.

286
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,964
What's the count?

287
00:21:48,998 --> 00:21:51,199
201.6.

288
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,436
Give it a second weigh
if you would, please.

289
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,237
New policy.

290
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:01,476
What, Walter?

291
00:22:03,379 --> 00:22:04,379
Where's Gus?

292
00:22:04,413 --> 00:22:05,714
Why?

293
00:22:05,748 --> 00:22:09,051
Because I would like
to speak with him.

294
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:15,325
Because,
the way we left things,

295
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,528
I-- I would like
the chance to clear the air.

296
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:20,664
Hmm.

297
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:22,733
What?

298
00:22:23,935 --> 00:22:26,437
Walter, you're never
going to see him again.

299
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:41,635
Oh, look who woke up hungry.

300
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,936
Are you hungry?

301
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,306
Yeah, that's good.
Drink that up.

302
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,276
Just a little longer,
okay, my sweetie?

303
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,477
Okay?

304
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:55,084
There you go.

305
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:57,721
Okay, now...

306
00:22:57,755 --> 00:23:03,160
the Dodge gets a detail,

307
00:23:03,194 --> 00:23:05,229
and...

308
00:23:05,263 --> 00:23:10,701
the Corolla gets a hand wax?

309
00:23:10,735 --> 00:23:13,036
Right? Hand wax.

310
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,371
Okay.

311
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:17,140
Oh. Hello. Hello.

312
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:19,708
Just a few more minutes,
and we're on our way home.

313
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:21,577
Okay, my sweet girl?

314
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:24,713
Mama's just
doing her work here.

315
00:23:24,748 --> 00:23:27,550
Mama's doing her work.

316
00:23:27,584 --> 00:23:28,718
Let's see.

317
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:35,025
Way to go, Hank.

318
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:36,927
Whoa, way to soldier up.

319
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,197
You're doing it!

320
00:23:41,232 --> 00:23:42,733
Come on!

321
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:45,202
Another few yards.

322
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:47,071
Damn!

323
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:50,908
Ahh, Jesus!

324
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,679
Look at you!
Way to go, honey!

325
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:56,146
Come on.

326
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,848
Come on, Hank!

327
00:23:57,883 --> 00:23:59,683
Keep it going!

328
00:24:01,887 --> 00:24:02,853
Uhh!

329
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:04,788
Just ten more steps.

330
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:06,157
9!

331
00:24:07,392 --> 00:24:08,426
8.

332
00:24:09,078 --> 00:24:09,878
7!

333
00:24:11,562 --> 00:24:12,139
6!

334
00:24:15,202 --> 00:24:17,137
You're almost there, Hank.

335
00:24:17,171 --> 00:24:19,105
Uhh!

336
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,742
God!
Ha ha ha ha!

337
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:24,377
Oh, yeah.
All right, buddy.

338
00:24:24,412 --> 00:24:26,513
That's what I call
kicking some ass.

339
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:28,481
Oh, it was awesome, babe!

340
00:24:28,516 --> 00:24:29,683
Ohh.

341
00:24:29,717 --> 00:24:31,051
Hell, yeah.

342
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:32,052
Very nice.

343
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:33,086
Yeah!

344
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,021
Hey!

345
00:24:39,327 --> 00:24:41,362
You're a good man, Chuck.
Thanks.

346
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,697
It's an honor, my friend.

347
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,032
Same time tomorrow?

348
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,902
Damn straight,
if I'm still alive.

349
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,539
Great session.
Lots of positive energy.

350
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,807
Lots.

351
00:24:55,176 --> 00:24:57,844
It's just it's so great
to see that.

352
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:01,514
It's just-- Yeah.

353
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,351
One day at a time.

354
00:25:04,385 --> 00:25:06,086
All we can do.

355
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,355
I know. It's just

356
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:10,357
you've got a real way with him.

357
00:25:10,391 --> 00:25:11,758
It's--

358
00:25:13,862 --> 00:25:15,396
You want to go full-time?

359
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,031
We've got a spare bedroom.

360
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:18,866
I'll see you tomorrow.

361
00:25:26,375 --> 00:25:27,642
Wow.

362
00:25:27,676 --> 00:25:30,411
You were so strong today.

363
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:31,679
Did you work up an appetite?

364
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:33,247
I'm sure that you did.

365
00:25:33,282 --> 00:25:35,883
Listen, I was thinking
about cooking tonight.

366
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,418
So--
Marie.

367
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:40,554
Get out.

368
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:05,282
Oh, yo, about time.

369
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:06,650
Oh, my God.

370
00:26:08,754 --> 00:26:11,289
Yo, what's up with the pie,
man? It ain't cut.

371
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:14,159
Yeah. Right.
That's the gimmick.

372
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:15,560
What gimmick?
This place.

373
00:26:15,594 --> 00:26:16,727
They don't cut their pizza,

374
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:18,662
and they pass the savings
on to you.

375
00:26:18,697 --> 00:26:20,965
What savings?
How much can it be to cut a damn pizza?

376
00:26:20,999 --> 00:26:23,533
Maybe it's, like,
democratic, bro, you know?

377
00:26:23,568 --> 00:26:26,637
Cut your own Christmas tree.
Cut your own pizza.

378
00:26:26,671 --> 00:26:28,305
Yeah. It's democratic.

379
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:30,407
What am I supposed
to do with this?

380
00:26:30,442 --> 00:26:31,675
Don't sweat it, yo.

381
00:26:31,709 --> 00:26:34,145
You got some, like, scissors?

382
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:36,114
I will cut this bitch up good.

383
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,485
Yo, come in!

384
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,354
Hey, would you mind?

385
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:45,924
I figure you make, like,
10 million pizzas a year.

386
00:26:45,959 --> 00:26:49,694
Each pizza takes,
like, 10 seconds to cut.

387
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,197
In man hours, that's--

388
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:54,532
I don't know.

389
00:26:55,601 --> 00:26:56,601
A lot?

390
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:57,669
Hey, Jesse.

391
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:58,703
Huh.

392
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:02,007
You got, um, yeah.

393
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:30,435
So, uh, how you doing?

394
00:27:32,071 --> 00:27:33,406
I'm dealing.

395
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,609
How's Brock?

396
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,333
Good. He's...

397
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:45,551
Brock, honey,
wait in the car, okay?

398
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:46,952
Let the grownups speak.

399
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:49,321
Go on, little man.
We'll catch up later.

400
00:27:55,528 --> 00:27:57,195
Guess you know
I've been calling.

401
00:27:58,998 --> 00:28:02,901
Yeah, um, I'm really
busy at work and--

402
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:07,606
Jesse, I'm not here to make
you come up with excuses.

403
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:09,809
You got other things going on.

404
00:28:09,843 --> 00:28:11,778
I get it.

405
00:28:11,812 --> 00:28:14,515
There's just one thing
you and me got to talk about.

406
00:28:15,984 --> 00:28:17,852
And that's this.

407
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:20,755
After Tomás was murdered,

408
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:21,890
two dudes from the block,

409
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:23,558
a couple bangers
he used to hang with,

410
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:25,727
get run over,
one of them shot in the head.

411
00:28:25,761 --> 00:28:29,931
Same night,
I get this in my mailbox.

412
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,639
This was you?

413
00:28:48,953 --> 00:28:50,387
You know what?

414
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:52,990
Whatever it is you had to do
with my brother's killers,

415
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:54,325
I don't want to know.

416
00:28:55,727 --> 00:28:57,762
But you got to tell me
one thing.

417
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,365
Is someone gonna come
looking for this?

418
00:29:03,569 --> 00:29:04,635
No.

419
00:29:10,575 --> 00:29:13,943
What exactly am I
supposed to do with this?

420
00:29:13,978 --> 00:29:15,879
Use it to get you and Brock

421
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:19,082
out of that shit hole
of a neighborhood.

422
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:22,285
Or you can go out
and spend it on glass,

423
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,087
and I'd have no way
of stopping you.

424
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:29,059
But I got to believe
you won't do that.

425
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:16,562
<i>Go home, Walter.</i>

426
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:41,926
How you doing?

427
00:32:43,262 --> 00:32:45,062
Hi.

428
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:46,564
Ton of bricks?

429
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,167
Rocks.

430
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,105
You, uh, want me
to wheel them inside for you?

431
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,340
Thank you.

432
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,383
Marie, is that my minerals?

433
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:06,984
Yes, Hank.

434
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,152
How many boxes?

435
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:09,453
I don't know--

436
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,389
Three, four, a hundred,

437
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,458
a million.

438
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,726
I don't know.

439
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,361
Did you check them for damage?

440
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,962
Oh, my God.

441
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,132
They're rocks, Hank.

442
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:23,233
No, they're minerals.

443
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:24,868
Jesus, Marie, I got
some geodes coming

444
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:27,237
that are very delicate,
all right?

445
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:29,840
And I will not accept
any boxes that have damage.

446
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,541
Those delivery jackoffs,
I'm telling you--

447
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,844
I'm not getting ass raped
by those bastards, all right?

448
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:34,878
Just--

449
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,848
Honey, would you check?

450
00:33:40,016 --> 00:33:41,784
Just check, please?

451
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:56,031
Hey, you, too much wax.

452
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:57,666
Stop wasting it.

453
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,635
Look, tell your brother

454
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:01,370
that if he doesn't
show up tomorrow,

455
00:34:01,404 --> 00:34:02,671
I'm going to have to fire him.

456
00:34:02,706 --> 00:34:06,442
So now go back.
And no more excuses.

457
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:10,078
Mr. Wolynetz,
my name is Skyler White.

458
00:34:10,113 --> 00:34:11,479
How do you do?

459
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:20,555
You want to buy my car wash.

460
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,959
I do. And I am prepared
to talk numbers right now,

461
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:25,193
if you'd like.

462
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:27,895
Do you think
this is an easy job?

463
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:31,833
You are willing to get down
on your hands and knees

464
00:34:31,867 --> 00:34:34,603
and scrub like a house maid

465
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:38,507
with all the chemicals
eating into your nice skin

466
00:34:38,542 --> 00:34:39,909
and stinging in your eyes?

467
00:34:39,943 --> 00:34:43,714
Well, I know a thing or two
about scrubbing.

468
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,315
Any other advice for me?

469
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,184
Because
I am serious about this.

470
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:48,553
Good.

471
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,022
I am serious, too.

472
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,390
I have worked 30 years

473
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,326
of building this business
from nothing,

474
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,027
with my own hands

475
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:58,728
and my own sweat and blood.

476
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,898
I can appreciate that, truly.

477
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,299
So, with that in mind,

478
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:06,068
is there a figure
you can quote me?

479
00:35:06,102 --> 00:35:07,970
One which you think
would adequately--

480
00:35:08,004 --> 00:35:09,538
$10 million.

481
00:35:17,314 --> 00:35:21,217
Well, let's try 879,000.

482
00:35:21,251 --> 00:35:22,885
Where do you come up
with this number?

483
00:35:22,919 --> 00:35:24,620
You pull it from your behind?

484
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,693
On a typical day,

485
00:35:30,727 --> 00:35:33,328
you manage 19 cars per hour.

486
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:35,930
Extrapolating,
I added the extra revenues

487
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:37,565
for hand waxes and detailing,

488
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,367
subtracted your overhead
and salary and maintenance,

489
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,536
operating fees, depreciation,

490
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,705
which I obtained
from comparable businesses

491
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,006
in the Albuquerque area,

492
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,543
giving me an estimate
of your annual cash flow here,

493
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:52,913
to which I applied the
industry standard multiplier

494
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:54,982
and added the market value
of your real estate,

495
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:59,721
giving me a total estimated
value of $829,000,

496
00:35:59,755 --> 00:36:04,993
on top of which I generously
added an extra $50,000...

497
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:08,564
so as not to be insulting.

498
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,634
$20 million.

499
00:36:13,203 --> 00:36:15,305
Okay, Mr. Wolynetz,
this--

500
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,907
This is the price
for Walter White.

501
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:20,944
Ah.
Oh, yes.

502
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,946
You don't think
I know who you are?

503
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,447
I remember.

504
00:36:24,482 --> 00:36:27,417
Well, I have not
pretended to be any--

505
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:30,753
Your husband, he quit
without giving me notice.

506
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:32,855
He broke my air fresheners.

507
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,692
He cursed at me
and grabbed himself.

508
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,094
And now he wants to buy
my car wash.

509
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,562
But he's not man enough

510
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,664
to come in here
and face me himself.

511
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:43,299
Instead, he sends his woman.

512
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,600
Excuse me?

513
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:46,702
Walter White wants
to buy my car wash.

514
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:50,939
The price he pays
is $20 million.

515
00:36:50,973 --> 00:36:52,274
Now please leave.

516
00:37:06,455 --> 00:37:08,489
<i>Have you recently
lost a loved one</i>

517
00:37:08,523 --> 00:37:11,258
<i>on an aviation disaster?</i>

518
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:13,428
<i>Have you suffered injury,</i>

519
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:15,029
<i>shock to the senses,</i>

520
00:37:15,064 --> 00:37:16,331
<i>or property damage</i>

521
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:18,334
<i>as a result of airplane debris</i>

522
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:20,803
<i>or, God forbid,
falling body parts?</i>

523
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:23,040
<i>Then call me, Saul Goodman.</i>

524
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,275
<i>It goes without saying</i>

525
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,577
<i>that the six-, seven-,</i>

526
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:28,312
<i>perhaps even eight-figure
cash settlement</i>

527
00:37:28,347 --> 00:37:29,547
<i>that I can win for you</i>

528
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,949
<i>will never fill the hole

529
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,717
<i>caused by your tragic loss,</i>

530
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,420
<i>but you deserve justice.</i>

531
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:38,156
<i>So if you want
to tip the scales</i>

532
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,524
<i>back in your favor,</i>

533
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,093
<i>better call Saul.</i>

534
00:37:41,127 --> 00:37:42,528
<i>Saul Goodman, attorney at law.</i>

535
00:37:42,563 --> 00:37:45,164
<i>(505)503-4455.
Hmm.</i>

536
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:48,234
<i>Se habla español.</i>

537
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,361
You might want to learn
how to tail better

538
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:15,963
if you're planning
on making a habit of it.

539
00:38:18,766 --> 00:38:20,601
May I buy you a drink?

540
00:38:22,837 --> 00:38:24,471
Next round, when you're done.

541
00:38:26,374 --> 00:38:29,609
Why not? You make a hell
of a lot more than I do.

542
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,551
Uh, another round for him,

543
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:40,054
and I'll have the same.
No ice.

544
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:53,099
I feel like I need
to explain myself.

545
00:38:53,134 --> 00:38:55,101
There were some actions
that I took

546
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:57,103
which I want you to understand.

547
00:38:58,806 --> 00:39:02,275
I didn't want any of this
to happen.

548
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:05,879
Everything I did

549
00:39:05,913 --> 00:39:08,948
I did out of loyalty
to my partner,

550
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:13,386
and then, later, of course,

551
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:16,122
it was purely
out of self-defense.

552
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,058
I hope you can
appreciate that...

553
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:22,529
just like I appreciated
that, uh--

554
00:39:26,634 --> 00:39:30,538
I appreciate that when
you were going to kill me

555
00:39:30,572 --> 00:39:32,740
you were simply
following orders.

556
00:39:32,774 --> 00:39:34,742
I get that completely.

557
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:37,312
And I harbor no ill will.

558
00:39:37,346 --> 00:39:41,249
Well, there's a load
off my mind.

559
00:39:42,585 --> 00:39:44,185
Mike,
I'm trying to tell you--

560
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,553
I get it.

561
00:39:45,588 --> 00:39:47,189
Fine.

562
00:39:47,223 --> 00:39:49,157
Drink up, Walter.

563
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:05,173
Hell of a last couple of weeks.

564
00:40:08,043 --> 00:40:11,045
Makes a man wonder
exactly where he stands.

565
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,551
Huh.

566
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:21,155
I mean, I--

567
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:24,992
I cannot be alone
in feeling this way.

568
00:40:26,194 --> 00:40:28,162
Not after what happened
to Victor.

569
00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:32,933
So...

570
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:36,804
what's with the piece?

571
00:40:36,838 --> 00:40:39,906
Right hip
inside your waistband.

572
00:40:39,941 --> 00:40:42,676
I noticed it the other
day at the lab.

573
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:45,213
You wear it if it
makes you feel better,

574
00:40:45,247 --> 00:40:47,615
but if push comes to shove,
it's not going to help.

575
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:51,219
Mike, do I have to come
right out and say this?

576
00:40:52,855 --> 00:40:56,558
You and I,
we're in the same boat.

577
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:57,993
Drink your drink.

578
00:40:58,027 --> 00:41:01,229
If it happened to Victor,
it could happen to you.

579
00:41:01,263 --> 00:41:03,431
And-- And what the hell
was that anyway?

580
00:41:03,466 --> 00:41:05,901
Hmm? A message?

581
00:41:05,935 --> 00:41:09,871
He cuts a man's throat
just to send a message?

582
00:41:09,906 --> 00:41:11,339
You won, Walter.

583
00:41:11,374 --> 00:41:13,609
You got the job.

584
00:41:15,145 --> 00:41:16,378
Do yourself a favor

585
00:41:16,412 --> 00:41:19,181
and learn to take yes
for an answer.

586
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:23,385
Yeah, I got the job,
but for how long?

587
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:31,694
Get me in a room with him.

588
00:41:31,728 --> 00:41:36,065
Mike, just get me in a room,

589
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:38,634
and I'll do the rest.

590
00:41:45,342 --> 00:41:46,842
You done?

591
00:41:51,515 --> 00:41:53,249
Yeah.

592
00:41:58,822 --> 00:42:00,023
Ohh!

593
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,259
Oof!

594
00:42:04,294 --> 00:42:05,361
Ohh!

595
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:29,251
Thanks for the drink.

596
00:42:32,222 --> 00:42:33,322
Ahh.

597
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,703
Hey, my man, you know
how to party, brother.

598
00:42:46,737 --> 00:42:49,339
Epic! Epic!

599
00:42:49,373 --> 00:42:52,142
Uh, seriously, where
are you two going?

600
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:56,480
Jesse, I've been awake for,
like, three straight days.

601
00:42:56,514 --> 00:42:58,549
I'm turning into a Sleestak.

602
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:02,252
So crash here. It's not
like I ain't got the space.

603
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:03,721
Yeah, that's cool and all,

604
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:06,323
but I think I got,
like, this cat.

605
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:10,494
I think I'm, like,
supposed to feed it.

606
00:43:10,528 --> 00:43:11,728
Whatever, you little bitch.

607
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:13,964
What about you?
You sticking,

608
00:43:13,998 --> 00:43:15,632
or do I got to flip you over

609
00:43:15,667 --> 00:43:17,301
and check you for a slizz?

610
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,536
Bro, I'm kind of
pushing flowers here, yo.

611
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:22,505
I ain't proud of it,
but it's God's honest truth.

612
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,343
Hell, brother, you know
we got man love for you.

613
00:43:26,378 --> 00:43:27,811
Now that you're
back in the mix,

614
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:30,848
it's like nothing
but good days ahead.

615
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:35,653
Plenty of time to pace it
out is all I'm saying.

616
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:36,754
Yeah.

617
00:43:36,788 --> 00:43:38,189
Yeah, man.

618
00:43:39,392 --> 00:43:40,458
Totally.

619
00:43:43,096 --> 00:43:45,831
I was thinking,
like, next week?

620
00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:48,668
Yeah, sure, man. Next week.

621
00:43:48,702 --> 00:43:50,737
Are we cool?

622
00:43:50,771 --> 00:43:52,572
We are cool.

1
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,798
Hey, guys.

2
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,194
So if it's okay, I was thinking
about using this one for the test.

3
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,316
Mom's brakes are very sticky...

4
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,395
...and you barely press down on them
and it's like a screech.

5
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,637
Sure.

6
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,199
But I'm good?

7
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,512
Yeah, you're great. Why?

8
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,277
Are my feet okay?

9
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,239
I looked it up. New Mexico says
all I need is a note from a doctor.

10
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,868
I know it's not the right way and all...

11
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,079
...but once I get my provisional,
I can keep working at it.

12
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,959
Well, as long as it gets you safely
from point A to point B...

13
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,680
...then who am I to argue?

14
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,713
Hi.

15
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,472
You're a sweet girl. Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

16
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,555
I know.

17
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,439
- Here you go.
- Here you go.

18
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,160
- All right.
- Thank you.

19
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,949
- Got it?
- Yeah.

20
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,350
Okay. All right.

21
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,634
- So 9 a.m. Saturday?
- Yes, 9 a.m. Saturday.

22
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,916
So which means
pick me up about 8:30?

23
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,640
- I'll be here with bells on.
- What?

24
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,429
It's just a saying.
Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.

25
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,469
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

26
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,437
- Hi. Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,909
- Could you keep an eye on your sister?
- Sure.

28
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,308
- Thanks.
- See you, Dad.

29
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,040
- Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
- Thank you.

30
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,591
Have you thought anymore
about what we discussed?

31
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,990
"Thought anymore"
meaning reconsidered? No.

32
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,469
So show me the flaw in it.

33
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,709
Flaws, Skyler.
Flaws. Plural, not singular.

34
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,112
Where do you want me to start?

35
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,070
Hey, I don't love this situation,
all right, that you put me in.

36
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,591
However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

37
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,716
You took the money
you won gambling...

38
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,269
...invested it in the car wash
you helped run.

39
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,672
You hired your wife as a bookkeeper,
because she's actually a bookkeeper.

40
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,877
That is a story an auditor can believe.
What am I missing?

41
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,759
You should just take this money
that I give you...

42
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,956
...and not look too closely at it.

43
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,398
So, if God forbid, I get caught...

44
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,994
...you maintain plausible deniability.

45
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,835
Okay, my estranged husband who,
when he was working...

46
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,436
...made $43,000 a year,
starts shovelling money at me.

47
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,989
And when the police come,
I'm supposed to say:

48
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,516
"I never thought about it, officers.
Made sense to me". Really?

49
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,070
That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

50
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,914
I tell you what, Walt...

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,152
...I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name...

52
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,799
...than some complete idiot.

53
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,075
So you're promoting caution here.

54
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,309
And you want a believable story.

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,598
That, it seems to me,
is the safest way...

56
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,278
...to make the best
out of a very bad situation, yes.

57
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,677
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot though.

58
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,669
Why would your estranged husband
be doing all this for you?

59
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,759
Because he loves his family and
desperately wants a reconciliation...

60
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,595
...though it may be hopeless
and futile.

61
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,958
Then again, he'd try anything.

62
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,596
I'm just not buying it.
No, I think it would be better...

63
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,911
...if the husband
were no longer estranged.

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,829
Yeah. Maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

65
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,913
And suddenly a fantasy story.

66
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,798
I am at least gonna be a part
of this household.

67
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,394
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

68
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,118
Not every night, no.

69
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,391
Six nights a week. One night off.

70
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,830
Dinner two nights. Not weekends.

71
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,672
With 24-hours' notice.

72
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,671
Five nights a week, with no notice.

73
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,910
Three. Six-hours' notice.

74
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,640
- Five nights a week, two hours' notice.
- Four.

75
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,753
Don't push it.

76
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,795
- And I want my own key to the house.
- No.

77
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,190
For emergencies and appearances,
yes.

78
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,114
I am going to babysit my own daughter,
help my son with his homework.

79
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,877
I am going to be a part of this family.
That is how we'll sell your little fiction.

80
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,191
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

81
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,075
No. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

82
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,431
Seriously.

83
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,796
Get a beer with me.

84
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,638
What?

85
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,356
What the hell are you doing?

86
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,670
That's ours, right?

87
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,152
Look at it and tell me if that's ours.

88
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,678
Yes, it's ours. Now put it away.

89
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,109
What the hell is wrong with you?

90
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,272
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

91
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,558
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

92
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,160
They had Combo shot down
in the street...

93
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,596
...and now it's our product
they're selling.

94
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,955
Which means they work for our guy.
Right?

95
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,556
What? No. What is that?
That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?

96
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,952
I heard it from the sister
of the kid who shot him.

97
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,514
Hear how I just said "kid"?

98
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,550
This kid, he's 11 years old.

99
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,632
Shot Combo on orders.

100
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,232
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

101
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,072
They got him...

102
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,071
And you know he's not the first.

103
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,675
They use kids because hey, why not?
Easy to control. Easy to fool.

104
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,070
All they get is juvie
if they get caught.

105
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,595
Hearts and minds, right?

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,514
Get them young
and they're yours forever.

107
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,157
These guys killed Combo.

108
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,552
They used this little kid
like some puppet.

109
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,830
They used him to shoot my friend.

110
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:38,038
So why are you telling me this?

111
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,836
I need your help.

112
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,755
How?

113
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,117
- I need ricin.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,355
- Oh, my God.
- Look, these two...

115
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,555
- Hey.
- No.

116
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,508
Hey, they gotta go. All right?
I got the... entire thing figured out.

117
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,636
- No.
- The delivery method, everything.

118
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,997
All I need from you is the poison,
that's all.

119
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,355
- No...
- Look.

120
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,200
- Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
- No.

121
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,555
You don't know
what you're talking about.

122
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,632
- Not even...
- Look, you don't get how right this is?

123
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,874
You don't get how the whole
entire world would be better off?

124
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,553
We're not talking about this.

125
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,235
I know a woman who buys
from these two once or twice a week.

126
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,791
They sit in their car all day and they
get hungry, so she brings them food...

127
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,235
...and they knock a few bucks
off her price.

128
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,960
There's your delivery system
right there.

129
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,315
- I could be a mile away.
- Jesus.

130
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,040
A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

131
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,351
Know what? That meth-head stood up
to your brother-in-law.

132
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,035
He questioned her for five hours.
She didn't give it up.

133
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,590
Know how you know?
Because you're not in prison right now.

134
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,149
Well, I know I would be in prison
after this.

135
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,357
Prison or worse.
And I'd be right alongside you.

136
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,239
No, Jesse, you cannot be serious.

137
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,392
This is a ridiculous idea.

138
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,109
It's ridiculous? What,
so you're saying it's not gonna work?

139
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,470
How about back when it was your plan?
When we were gonna use it on Tuco.

140
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,359
- Apples and oranges.
- Guy eats ricin...

141
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,957
...two or three days later he gets the flu
or a heart attack and he keels over.

142
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,396
That's what you said.
Untraceable back to us.

143
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,755
To me.

144
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,432
Not even that other scumbag
we work for is ever gonna figure it out.

145
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,798
It was a good plan back when
it was Tuco, and it's a good plan now.

146
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,114
Tuco wanted to murder us.
These guys don't.

147
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,910
Apples and oranges. Do I really have
to sit here and explain the difference?

148
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,039
Combo was us, man.

149
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,476
He was one of us.
Does that mean nothing?

150
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,713
Why didn't you go after these guys
two or three months ago?

151
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,871
Because I just found out about them.

152
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,473
What's to find out?

153
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,312
It's a dispute over turf, right?

154
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,315
I mean, how hard could it have been for
you to track them down on their turf...

155
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,153
...and kill them months ago?

156
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,031
Because back then, you were too busy
getting high, feeling sorry.

157
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,992
Now, murder is not part
of your 12-step programme.

158
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,391
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

159
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,030
What you are talking about here
is pointless.

160
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,630
This achieves nothing.

161
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,951
It accomplishes nothing.

162
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,152
If you don't see
what it accomplishes...

163
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,233
...then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

164
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,229
Jesse, listen to me.

165
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,677
You are not a murderer.

166
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,077
I'm not, and you're not.

167
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,195
It's as simple as that.

168
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,118
Jesse.

169
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,476
I'm doing it.

170
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,997
With or without you.

171
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,113
Knock, knock.

172
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,956
Chrissakes, Marie, you don't say
"knock, knock," you... like that.

173
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,873
- I like saying it.
- Well, that's not the rules.

174
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,200
- Okay?
- You knock your way, I'll knock mine.

175
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,351
But look, see? I win.

176
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,397
Not so fast.

177
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,470
Christ, again? That's three in a row.

178
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,076
Got a fricking Paul Newman
over here?

179
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,471
- Been playing cards with your dad?
- No. Why?

180
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,552
How is your old man?

181
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,914
Back teaching?

182
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,231
No. I don't think
either of them are working...

183
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,595
...right now.
- How they swinging that?

184
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,557
- I don't know.
- Hey...

185
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,359
...did you know
the doctors told your Uncle Hank...

186
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,750
...he can get out of here
anytime he wants?

187
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,070
Oh, yeah? That's great.

188
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,676
- Yeah, I'm not so sure about that.
- Why not?

189
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,799
What? That's what they said.

190
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,473
Because they want the room.

191
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,279
They hit the sheets with Lysol,
reset the meter...

192
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,035
...and wheel the next slob in.
We went over this, Marie. Drop it.

193
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,310
Are you not well enough?

194
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,477
Jesus, kid, you too?
Do I look well enough?

195
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,279
I'm shitting in pans,
peeing in pitchers.

196
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,034
I can't move my legs. Got it?

197
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,431
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

198
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,151
What about people on crutches?
Maybe I should be in here too.

199
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,435
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- Exactly. Deal, you little prick.

200
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,158
Bitch.

201
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,874
You know I'm hourly, right?

202
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,711
He promised me
that he would be here.

203
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,438
Oh, he promised.

204
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,957
Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then.
That's a joke. The kid ain't coming.

205
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:42,830
- Okay, so, what's plan B?
- I don't know.

206
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,193
- I really don't.
- Well, let's brainstorm.

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,390
- You really think he's serious?
- That's why I'm here, Saul.

208
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,997
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it. Or try, at least.

209
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,230
Okay, so we pay him off.

210
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:00,995
No, no, it's not about money.
It's about getting him off the streets.

211
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,720
Getting him to calm down.

212
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,792
Maybe...

213
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,031
What if we, maybe...?

214
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,750
Could you get him arrested?

215
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,395
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

216
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,790
No, now listen.
I know it sounds risky.

217
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,350
But it wouldn't anything
that would get him into real trouble...

218
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,239
...and nothing that could lead back
to our business.

219
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,913
Just some minor offence.

220
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,833
Pinkman in jail? I don't know.
I'm picturing it and...

221
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,915
No, not jail as in "jail" jail.

222
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,793
I'm talking about
one of those situations...

223
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,999
...where you're in an orange jumpsuit
picking up litter along the highway.

224
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,317
That's jail.

225
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,670
You're talking about a level-two joint.

226
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
Something that keeps him off the street
for 30 days.

227
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,358
Then by the time he gets out...

228
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,239
...tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

229
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,154
Well, Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact, you know.

230
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:08,198
In the past,
I've recommended Springer...

231
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,388
...but I'm hearing chancy things about
their bathrooms since they renovated.

232
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,879
So...

233
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,156
So it's possible, right?

234
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,869
Well, it falls under
my Premium Services Package...

235
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,397
...but you can afford that.
I'll call my PI.

236
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,114
You understand what you have to do?

237
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,629
And you can never talk to anyone,
right?

238
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,675
I mean, ever. Understand?

239
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,432
Yeah.

240
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,753
I found this stuff on the Internet.

241
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,956
Takes days to kick in.

242
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,271
Just keep quiet
and this won't ever come back to you.

243
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,715
You okay with this, right?

244
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,479
Just think of it
like it's the same thing as always.

245
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,279
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

246
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,798
It's not just delivering hamburgers.

247
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,636
Hey. You got a kid, right?

248
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,792
- What's his name?
- Patrick.

249
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,034
All right, imagine these two guys
had Patrick working as a mule.

250
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,037
Making him kill people.

251
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,998
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

252
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,038
Of course, I would.
I do all kinds of things for him.

253
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,314
Okay, so...

254
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,109
...these guys are using kids like that.

255
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,996
They gotta go. Right?

256
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,638
Good.

257
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,351
Tomorrow.

258
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,876
I'll be in touch.

259
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,309
Yeah. I bet that tastes good, huh?

260
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,832
Hey.

261
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,431
Come here, baby.

262
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,478
Okay. Here we go.

263
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,915
Here we go.

264
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,197
What are you doing?
If you need to talk, use the phone.

265
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,352
This isn't a phone talk, Walter.

266
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,875
Your wife's out, right?

267
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,952
Isn't she something?

268
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,680
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

269
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,354
What can I do for you?

270
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,915
Have a seat, Walter.

271
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:26,191
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

272
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,150
- And?
- Well, I'm not gonna do it.

273
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,357
- Why?
- Because it's moronic.

274
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,549
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

275
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,508
- That's not the moronic part.
- Okay. So, what's the problem?

276
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,592
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

277
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,595
Saul?

278
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,911
My boss.

279
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,628
Your boss.

280
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,548
This is a professional courtesy.
No one knows I'm here. Understand?

281
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,917
But our employer would find out,
like always.

282
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,993
And if Pinkman were arrested,
he'd take it as a problem.

283
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,718
Walt...

284
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,191
...you got a good thing going here.
We all do.

285
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,113
You wanna risk it all on one junkie?

286
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,350
Now, I realise
you two have a history...

287
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,877
...but this kid's been on the bubble
a while now. It's a long time coming.

288
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,558
What is?

289
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,272
I used to be a beat cop,
a long time ago.

290
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
I'd get called on domestic disputes
all the time.

291
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,355
Hundreds, probably, over the years.

292
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,559
But there was this one guy, this one
piece of shit that I will never forget.

293
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,599
Gordie. He looked like Bo Svenson.
You remember him?

294
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,558
<i>- Walking Tall?</i> You don't remember?
- No.

295
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,510
Anyway, big boy, 270, 280...

296
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,719
...but his wife...
Or whatever she was... His lady...

297
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,838
...was real small. Like a bird.

298
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,514
Wrists like little branches.

299
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,996
Anyway, my partner and I'd
get called out there... every weekend...

300
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,549
...and one of us would
pull her aside and say:

301
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,280
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

302
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,432
This wasn't one of those
"deep down, he loves me" setups.

303
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,717
We got a lot of those, but not this.
This girl was scared.

304
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,111
She wasn't gonna cross him.
No way, no how.

305
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,556
Nothing we could do but pass her
to the EMT's, put him a car...

306
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,280
...drive him downtown,
throw him in a drunk tank.

307
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,273
He sleeps it off,
next morning, out he goes.

308
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,634
Back home.

309
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,071
But one night...

310
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,271
...my partner's out sick,
and it's just me.

311
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,715
The call comes in
and it's the usual crap.

312
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,519
Broke her nose in the shower
kind of thing.

313
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,513
So I cuff him, put him in the car
and away we go.

314
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,596
Only that night...

315
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,430
...we're driving into town...

316
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,958
...and this sideways asshole is in
my back seat humming "Danny Boy."

317
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,314
And it just rubbed me wrong.

318
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,069
So instead of left, I go right,
out into nowhere.

319
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,119
And I kneel him down
and I put my revolver in his mouth...

320
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:24,071
...and I told him,
"This is it. This is how it ends."

321
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,238
And he's crying,
going to the bathroom all over himself.

322
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,709
Swearing to God
he's gonna leave her alone.

323
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,998
Screaming, much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

324
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,875
And I told him to be quiet.

325
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,112
That I needed to think
about what I was gonna do here.

326
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,909
And, of course, he got quiet...

327
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,036
...goes still and real quiet.

328
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,189
Like a dog waiting for dinner scraps.

329
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,198
Then we just stood there for a while.

330
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,958
Me, acting like
I'm thinking things over...

331
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,636
...and Prince Charming kneeling
in the dirt with shit in his pants.

332
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,588
And after a few minutes,
I took the gun out of his mouth...

333
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,350
...and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again...

334
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,514
...I will such and such and such,
and blah, blah, blah."

335
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,238
It was just a warning?

336
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,915
Of course.

337
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,792
Just trying to do the right thing.

338
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,158
But two weeks later he killed her.

339
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,595
Of course.

340
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,594
Caved her head in
with the base of a Waring blender.

341
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,598
We got there, there was so much blood,
you could taste the metal.

342
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,554
Moral of the story is...

343
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,200
...I chose a half measure...

344
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,239
...when I should have
gone all the way.

345
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,632
I'll never make that mistake again.

346
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,152
No more half measures, Walter.

347
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,831
Man, I don't get this.

348
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,709
I don't get this at all.
All I'm seeing is the kid.

349
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,957
So where are they?

350
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,157
I don't know. They're always around.

351
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,108
Burgers are getting cold.

352
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,398
So is it, like, fast?

353
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,039
Don't sweat it.
You're just doing what you do.

354
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,760
Hey, nobody's gonna know anything.

355
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,113
- Can I have another bump?
- Look, you had your bump.

356
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,113
Get this thing done,
then you can have all you want.

357
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,317
Gonna need you to come with me.

358
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,071
Take a walk.

359
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,957
Where we going?

360
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,597
Sit down.

361
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,756
I understand that you have a problem
with two of my employees.

362
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,636
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

363
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,109
It is possible they acted rashly.

364
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,393
But, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

365
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,835
The man was selling
on their territory.

366
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,434
There is blame on both sides.

367
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,072
This will go no further.

368
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,472
It will be settled right here,
right now.

369
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,470
You told him?

370
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,029
Wait outside.

371
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,676
Listen to me. You have one friend
in this room. This man.

372
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,838
Those men outside
are my trusted employees.

373
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,232
And when I learned
what you intended to do...

374
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,429
If it wasn't for this man
and the respect I have for him...

375
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,956
...I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

376
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,317
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

377
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,594
This is what happens now.
My men will come back inside...

378
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,117
...and you will shake their hands
and you will make peace.

379
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,748
And that will be the... end of this.

380
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,559
No.

381
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,713
Jesse.

382
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:28,436
- Pardon me?
- They use kids.

383
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,229
These assholes got an 11 -year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

384
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,517
You're supposed to be some kind
of a reasonable businessman.

385
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,716
This how you do business?

386
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,113
You okay with this?
You got anything to say here?

387
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,397
Bring them back.

388
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,271
No more children.

389
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,392
Understand?

390
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,033
And you...

391
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,076
...you keep the peace.

392
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,192
Say it.

393
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,790
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

394
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,393
Shake hands.

395
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,120
Jesse, your actions...

396
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,438
...they affect other people.

397
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,760
Sometimes
compromises have to be made...

398
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,800
...for the best of reasons.

399
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,635
Jesse. Jesse.

400
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,435
Marie, let the people
who get paid to do this do this.

401
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,558
The people who get paid to do this
do a lousy job.

402
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,755
So I guess this is what you want,
huh?

403
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,675
Just lying in a hospital bed
getting sponge baths from nurses.

404
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,432
Marie.

405
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,353
It's time to go home, Hank.

406
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,069
How many times I gotta tell you, Marie?
Not till I'm well.

407
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,992
Hey, hey, hey. What are you doing?

408
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,513
I'm just seeing.

409
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,229
- Seeing what?
- Seeing what I see.

410
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,069
- I'm not at my best here, Marie.
- We'll see.

411
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,511
Nothing's gonna happen.

412
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,869
I say it will.

413
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,749
No. I'm in this bed for a reason.

414
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,351
It's a waste of time.

415
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,390
Besides, what if someone comes in?

416
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,757
- I don't care if someone walks in.
- What's wrong with you?

417
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,628
I'll tell you what. If I can get
the groundhog to see his shadow...

418
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,279
Not gonna happen. I'm sorry.

419
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,638
I'm betting it will.
And if he does, you check out of here.

420
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,113
I'm not gonna bet
on whether I can get a boner.

421
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,352
- No bet. There's no bet here. No bet.
- Afraid you'll lose?

422
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,069
You know, you're just...
You're just being foolish, you know?

423
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,073
Come on. What's the point?

424
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,710
The point is
you're not completely hopeless.

425
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,231
We have a bet?

426
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,673
You know what?

427
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,877
If it'll get you out of here quicker.
You got one minute.

428
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,029
- One minute?
- Yeah.

429
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,838
All right. That's a cakewalk.

430
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,797
You know, this is just...

431
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,837
This is just sad. I mean...

432
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,835
I really feel sorry for you,
Marie, you know? I really do. It's just...

433
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,469
- It's pathetic.
- That's good, keep talking.

434
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,712
Protest. Struggle.

435
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,833
Marie, give up.
I mean, seriously, it's...

436
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,153
...not...

437
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,149
...gonna happen.

438
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,152
Bad day?

439
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,829
I don't even know.

440
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,758
Anyway...

441
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,235
...it's better now.

442
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,996
Tell them you're busy.

443
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,112
Hello?

444
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,478
Grandma?

445
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,552
Slow down.

446
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,991
Slow down, I can't...

447
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,318
Oh, God.

448
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,110
Oh, God.

449
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,431
Oh, God.

450
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,037
Tomas!

451
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,352
No.

452
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,830
You have to let me in. Please.

453
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,718
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

454
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,518
Jesse, you are now 42 minutes late.

455
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,355
I'm starting without you.

456
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,710
<i>- What is "wasabi"?</i>
<i>- Wasabi. Right you are.</i>

457
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,199
<i>Four-letter word, 1200.</i>

458
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,399
<i>Pilots and musicians</i>
<i>know this word derives from...</i>

459
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,357
Dinner's almost ready, okay?

460
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,158
Okay.

461
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,118
<i>- What is "solo"?</i>
- This guy's good.

462
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,508
<i>Four letter word, 2000.</i>

463
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,912
<i>"A loud, harsh cry;</i>
<i>Walt Whitman's was barbaric."</i>

464
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,991
- "Yell."
- What is "yawp"?

465
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,354
<i>- Kevin.</i>
<i>- What is "yawp"?</i>

466
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,397
<i>- Yawp.</i>
<i>- Tokyo, 1200.</i>

- <i>This crustacean...</i>
- What the heck's a yawp?

468
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,633
A yawp is a yell. I'll be right back.

469
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,234
That's what I said.

470
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,277
Okay to use your bathroom, right?

471
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,949
Yeah, okay.

472
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:47,512
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

473
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,157
<i>Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.</i>

474
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,029
Look, I hope you're not waiting for an
apology because I did not rat you out.

475
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,397
I was looking out for
your best interests, as well as my own.

476
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,676
And I stand by my decision
100 percent...

477
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,549
...so we'll just have to agree
to disagree.

478
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,237
Anyway, just call me back.

479
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,875
- So the TV turns itself off, huh?
- Yeah.

480
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,553
I'll get it.

481
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,633
<i>- The beginning of an early cold snap.</i>
<i>But first, more details on...</i>

482
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,233
Where's the remote?

483
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,994
<i>The murder of a young boy</i>
<i>in the South Valley.</i>

484
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,276
<i>Police have yet</i>
<i>to release a statement...</i>

485
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:41,477
<i>...but sources indicate</i>
<i>that 11-year-old Tomas Cantillo...</i>

486
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,552
<i>...may have been the victim</i>
<i>of a gang-related execution.</i>

487
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,314
<i>An anonymous tip brought police</i>
<i>to a playground...</i>

488
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,392
<i>...in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue</i>
<i>late last night.</i>

489
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,314
<i>Paramedics were called to the scene</i>
<i>but were unable to revive the boy.</i>

490
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,199
<i>- A gruesome crime...</i>
- Can you turn that off?

491
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,669
<i>Yet another casualty</i>
<i>in what appears to be...</i>

492
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,910
<i>...the city's ongoing struggle...</i>
- Walt?

493
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,629
<i>...against drugs and the gangs</i>
<i>that peddle them. We'll be passing...</i>

494
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,551
Hand me your dad...

495
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:18,511
I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking
about that all day, and it's just...

496
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,557
No. Yeah.

497
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,313
Hey, did you know your Dad and I...

498
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,278
...are thinking about
starting a business together?

499
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,351
Seriously?

500
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,154
What kind of business?

501
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,311
We're thinking maybe a car wash.

502
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,471
What do you mean? Like the...?

503
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,149
I'm sorry, I have to go.

504
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,675
Oh, my God.

505
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,955
Run.

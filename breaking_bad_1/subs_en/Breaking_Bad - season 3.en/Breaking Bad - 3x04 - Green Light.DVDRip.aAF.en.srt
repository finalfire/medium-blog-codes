1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,669
So cigarettes and gas is $79.70.

2
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,998
Crap.

3
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,112
There's an ATM right outside.

4
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,556
Yeah, I don't have a card.

5
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,516
Well, you can write a personal cheque
with ID.

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,237
Kind of in between banks right now.

7
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,038
You think I could just
come back later?

8
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,112
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back, I swear.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,991
If it were me, I'd be totally,
you know, "No problem."

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,913
But my dad is
this ginormous hard-ass.

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,356
He was in Fallujah for a year.

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,956
And he always checks the receipts.
I mean, like, always.

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,118
I gotta call him. I'm sorry.

14
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,633
Wait, wait, wait.

15
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,871
Hold on a second.

16
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,195
Maybe we could...

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,752
...trade.

18
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,913
Ever try it?

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,673
I mean, I smoke pot a lot sometimes.

20
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,634
I party.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,114
But...

22
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,199
- But that stuff's really addictive, right?
- Not really.

23
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,670
It's just a media thing. You know?

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,351
What's it like?

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,719
It's awesome.

26
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,351
Everything's maximum interesting.

27
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,471
You get these really cold
and sharp-like action dagger feelings.

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,673
It's awesome.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,118
Come on. What do you say?

30
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,438
Have a nice day.

31
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,159
So how does it feel?

32
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,829
Does it hurt?

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,270
Yeah, it's tight.

34
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,637
- Yeah, but is it painful?
- It's hard to breathe.

35
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,995
Well, you need your breathing.

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,751
Although let's not lose sight
of the fact...

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,230
...that you were the victim
of a terrible accident, Antonio...

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,834
...so some discomfort is
to be... expected.

39
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,990
Let's go with that one.

40
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,157
A cashier's chequ<i>e, por fav or.</i>

41
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,233
Oh, and spread the word.
I'm building a class-action, flight 515.

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,958
Victims' families would be great.

43
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,680
I'll take anyone on the ground
who suffered emotionally.

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,912
Anxiety, sleeplessness.
You get the picture.

45
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,399
Trouble?

46
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,836
<i>Ted Benek e? You cannot be serious.</i>

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,197
<i>- That guy is a jok e.</i>
<i>- You know what? You called my bluff.</i>

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,549
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

49
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,757
<i>You dared me to tell the police</i>
<i>and I couldn't do it, so you win.</i>

50
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,230
<i>If you want to stay in this house, fine,</i>
<i>but we are not married anymore.</i>

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,631
<i>I told you that</i>
<i>I was done cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,313
<i>- I promised you that.</i>
- <i>So what?</i>

53
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,835
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>At least I didn't run off to go...</i>

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,151
<i>Jesus! I mean, everything that I did,</i>
<i>I did for this family.</i>

55
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,312
<i>- Just k eep telling yourself that.</i>
<i>- What is that supposed to mean?</i>

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,118
<i>You don't lik e it, then leave.</i>

57
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,477
<i>- And tak e your drug money with you.</i>
<i>- That's what you want.</i>

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,595
- Jesus.
- Garbage disposal.

59
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,512
<i>You think this will get me</i>
<i>to move out?</i>

60
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,353
<i>You can screw Ted. You can screw</i>
<i>the butcher, the mailman.</i>

61
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,919
<i>- God, Walt.</i>
<i>- Whoever you want.</i>

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,674
<i>Screw them all.</i>
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

63
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,512
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

64
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,190
Is this a good or bad thing?

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,788
<i>Suit myself.</i>
<i>You want me to suit myself?</i>

66
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,678
<i>I'll suit myself to his face!</i>

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,918
It's a bad thing.

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,793
Hello.

69
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,638
Walter White to see Ted Beneke.

70
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,679
I'm sorry.
Mr. Beneke's on a conference call.

71
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,516
Okay. I will wait.

72
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,511
It could be a while.

73
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,558
I have all the time in the world.

74
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,111
Okay.

75
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,750
- Here we go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

76
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,990
- Mr. Beneke's not available.
- Ted? Come on.

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,798
Sir, excuse me.

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,268
Excuse me.

79
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,078
Ted, I can see you.

80
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,595
I can see you standing right there
in your office.

81
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,795
Now, come on.

82
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,638
Open the door. Come on, let's talk.
I just want to talk. That's all.

83
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,314
Come on, let's be men about this.
Okay? How about that?

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,788
Hey, Walt. I'm kind of in the middle
of something now.

85
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,598
Oh, yes, you are.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,433
So open the door.

87
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,830
You're damn right.
You're right in the middle.

88
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,355
Just open the door
and let's talk about it, okay?

89
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,590
Open the door, Ted, right now.

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,548
You don't want to be a man about it?
Plan B. How do you like that? Plan B.

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,474
We have a situation.

92
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,835
Walt. Walt. Walt.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,150
What are you doing?

94
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,959
I'm talking with Ted.

95
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,072
Next time, you'll open the door.

96
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,755
- Freeze! Come on.
- Oh, damn it.

97
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,239
No, I'm just here to talk.

98
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,595
- I just want to talk to him.
- Outside. Let's go.

99
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,196
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

100
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,271
- Calm down.
- I'm just... Okay, all right.

101
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,591
All right, all right, all right.
I'm calm. I'm calm.

102
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,993
Asshole.

103
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,996
What do you want?
What do you want?

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,958
Hey! Hey, come on.

105
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,679
What the hell is wrong with you?

106
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,195
You act like you're the first guy
this happened to.

107
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,830
I caught my second wife screwing
my stepdad, okay?

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,151
It's a cruel world, Walt. Grow up.

109
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:41,236
- I just wanted to talk to him.
- Yeah, well, now I'm talking to you.

110
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,231
Consider this an inte... ntion.

111
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,073
You could have been arrested
back there. You understand.

112
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,152
Speaking as your lawyer,
I'm always looking for billable hours.

113
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,470
But speaking as
your business associate...

114
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,359
...I'm strongly advising
that you get your shit together.

115
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,598
Just cool it with this Beneke guy,
at least for now. Okay?

116
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,435
Let's talk shop, because
I think this is a great opportunity...

117
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,149
...to channel some of that negative
energy into something positive.

118
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,232
- How did you know?
- Sorry?

119
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,875
About Skyler.
About where to find me just now.

120
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,917
How did you know?

121
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,829
That's just my meticulousness.
Don't bog down in detail, Walt.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,958
- The lesson here should be...
- Did you bug my house?

123
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,435
Yeah, but I didn't know it was
your house, did I?

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,114
You'd moved out.
Besides, you basically told me to.

125
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,158
- I told you to?
- You strongly hinted that I should.

126
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,199
You were worried your wife might say
something to the police.

127
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,751
What? No, no, that's not true.
When the hell did I say that?

128
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,434
Let's not get lost in the who,
what and whens.

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,673
The point is we did our due diligence
and she didn't talk.

130
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,796
She kept quiet.
She stood by you, Walt...

131
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,748
...which, if you ask me,
is the ironical silver lining here.

132
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,672
I mean, on the one hand...

133
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,436
...sure, she snuck off the reservation
to get some dirty, damp and deep.

134
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,828
On the other hand...

135
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,794
Off me.

136
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,197
You're fired!

137
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,713
- You're done!
- Good!

138
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,598
"Oh, boohoo,
I won't cook meth anymore".

139
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,557
You're a crybaby. Who needs you?

140
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,314
I'm unplugging the website,
so no more money laundering.

141
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,469
How do you like that?

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,234
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

143
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,550
I want them out now!

144
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,349
You just bought a $300 suit, psycho!

145
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,233
Go.

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,309
Great, drilled right into the stucco.

147
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,439
A little bit of putty, you'll be fine.

148
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,468
Just make sure
you get all of those things.

149
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,792
A, these things cost $800 apiece.

150
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,439
B, you're not that interesting.

151
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,558
So yeah, I'll get all of them, Walter.

152
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,993
Great line of work, by the way.
Real upstanding field.

153
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,952
Yeah, well...

154
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,511
...I enjoy it.

155
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,111
You're free to leave now. Anytime.

156
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,234
You know, Walter...

157
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,594
...sometimes it doesn't hurt
to have someone watching your back.

158
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,919
Mr. White?

159
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,793
Hi.

160
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,199
What's up?

161
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,839
I can't begin to understand
what you're going through, Walt...

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,790
...with all of your health concerns
and the stresses you've been under.

163
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,518
But still, as educators...

164
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,559
...there are certain responsibilities
we need to be meeting here...

165
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,359
...to the school
and to the students themselves.

166
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,033
Of course.

167
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,679
Is this a wheaten terrier?

168
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,113
Norfolk.

169
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,079
Norfolk?

170
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,637
That's surprising.

171
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,228
Walt, could you come back over here
and have a seat, please?

172
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,519
Sure.

173
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,233
You've been absent a lot recently.

174
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,315
And when you are here at school, there
have been some behavioural questions.

175
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,869
And frankly I'm concerned.

176
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,189
Thank you.

177
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,433
Are you feeling okay?

178
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,472
Do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

179
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,232
No.

180
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,511
Let's just keep this...

181
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,272
What...?

182
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,833
Hey!

183
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,195
Walt, what's wrong with you?

184
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,759
You know, look, you're the one
always talking about D.C., okay?

185
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,558
This is how you get there.

186
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,553
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

187
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,917
Besides, you know,
it's a big deal to get picked for this.

188
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,869
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

189
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,033
I could get killed crossing the street,
okay?

190
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,317
Whatever. You know, I want to go.

191
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,678
What about last time?

192
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,798
What about last time?

193
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,473
Schrader.

194
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,395
Hey, sheriff. Yeah.

195
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,749
Blue, huh?

196
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,832
Yeah, yeah. Thing is...

197
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,439
Thing is I'm supposed to be getting
on a plane right now.

198
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,153
The stuff this guy had was blue.
You sure about that?

199
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,632
Yeah.

200
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,518
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

201
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,993
Taxi.

202
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,599
- Hi.
- Man, I'm sorry.

203
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,957
I needed to talk to you,
but you weren't at your apartment.

204
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,390
No, I moved back home.

205
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,473
That's good, right?

206
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,589
Yeah.

207
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,752
- Yo, did you just get fired?
- No.

208
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,351
No, no, no.

209
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,794
It's more like a sabbatical.

210
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,790
Indefinite. Yeah.

211
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,237
So, what's up?

212
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,837
Should we go somewhere?

213
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,076
No, this is fine.

214
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,713
So I want an intro to your guy.

215
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,279
What guy?

216
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,632
Your guy. Your distribution guy.
The guy Saul hooked you up with.

217
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,870
No, no, no. Come on, Jesse.

218
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,394
- I thought about it and I want to.
- God.

219
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,278
It's the one thing I'm good at.

220
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,034
No, that is just not true.

221
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,668
You're good at a lot of things, son.

222
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,159
Like what?

223
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,071
What about your sobriety?

224
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,155
I told you, I'm not using.

225
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,114
Ever.

226
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,876
I just want back into the business.

227
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,076
Well, I don't. I'm sorry.

228
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,318
I know, and that's cool.

229
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,950
I'm not asking you to cook.

230
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,752
What's this?

231
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,592
In the... end, I just went with
two reflux condensers.

232
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,149
I didn't want to lose track
of my pH levels.

233
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,154
But I did everything else
just like you taught me.

234
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,633
Super careful in my amounts...

235
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,190
...and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

236
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,396
So, what do you think?
It's good, right?

237
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,994
What in the hell is this?

238
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,312
- What?
- What?

239
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,836
This. This. This is my product.

240
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,389
This is my formula. This is mine.

241
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,712
It's our product,
but yeah, I was gonna cut you in.

242
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,472
Oh, you were gonna cut me in?

243
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,996
No, no, no. I cut you in.

244
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,835
What the hell is your problem?
All I'm asking is for you to set a meet.

245
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,798
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

246
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,599
Because I am not gonna lend my name
to an inferior product.

247
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,035
I mean, look at the diameters here.

248
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,918
What did you use for reduction?

249
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,878
Don't tell me. Platinum dioxide, right?

250
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,032
No. Mercury-aluminium amalgam.

251
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,270
The dioxide's too hard to keep wet.

252
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,590
All right, well,
you must've done it wrong, then.

253
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,435
Your colour is all cloudy, so you were
struggling with distillation too.

254
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,239
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

255
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,277
I'm actually embarrassed for you.

256
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,994
What?

257
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,509
No way. I gave out samples
and everyone said it was the bomb.

258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,995
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

259
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,038
And who were they, I wonder?
A bunch of meth heads?

260
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,189
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,920
- They should know, right?
- Yeah, well, sorry.

262
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,310
- I can't help you.
- Fine, ass-wad.

263
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,392
- I'll contact the guy myself.
- Oh, yeah? Well, good luck.

264
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,711
Because my guy is a pro
and he doesn't deal with junkies.

265
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,519
- You know what? Eat me.
- Anytime, loser.

266
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,749
Hey, hey, hey!

267
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,828
Wait. Hey!

268
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,834
I can't believe it's only 4:00.

269
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,117
This day is dragging.

270
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,038
Okay.

271
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,037
I wish I could stay.

272
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,676
So stay.

273
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,431
What's stopping you?

274
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,758
What, like... everything, you mean?

275
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,833
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

276
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,077
So move in here.

277
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,755
And then my son hating me
even more.

278
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,514
That'll pass.
I went through that with the girls.

279
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,079
They adapt.

280
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,792
And now everyone at work thinks
I'm an evil ladder-climbing whore.

281
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,599
They're all fired,
effective immediately.

282
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,318
What else?

283
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,552
Oh, aren't you the answer man?

284
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,514
Where did it...?

285
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,397
Where did it go wrong, exactly,
with you and Walt?

286
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,751
I mean, I always saw him as kind of...

287
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,158
...mild-mannered.

288
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:55,828
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick or...?

289
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,396
I don't know what changed, Ted.

290
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,551
And I just don't feel really comfortable
talking about it.

291
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,598
Sorry.

292
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,876
Just asking out of self-interest.

293
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,600
Gotta make sure
I don't make the same mistake.

294
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,716
I would be amazed.

295
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,835
Just let me see if
I'm following you here, Russell.

296
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,596
You got this stuff from some guy
at Gasparza's...

297
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,512
...who was wearing tan pants...

298
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,673
...and who you're 80 percent sure
had a moustache.

299
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,193
That's it, right?

300
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,069
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

301
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,198
Russell.

302
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,390
Everything all right in there?

303
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,110
Mel. The dude's name was Mel.

304
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,599
Well, there you go. See?
You served an actual earthly function.

305
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,557
I can't believe I remembered that.

306
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,599
Mel who?
Does he have a last name?

307
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,916
Yeah, Mel.

308
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,834
Wait.

309
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,349
Was it Mel...

310
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,869
...or Mark?

311
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,958
It was definitely an M name.

312
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,156
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

313
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,675
Wait, wait.

314
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,232
Yeah.

315
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,070
It's gone.

316
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,559
It's gone.

317
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,870
- It was an M name though.
- Yeah.

318
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,838
I remember the... sound.

319
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,552
All right, well,
we'll go with the... sound.

320
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,358
- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

321
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,476
He definitely had tan pants.

322
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,437
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

323
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,194
Okay, it's after 9,
so this bar that Girl George is at...

324
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,237
...probably wall-to-wall dirtbags
by now.

325
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,599
Let's go have a little looky-loo,
see if we can't find this M-named clown.

326
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,349
What? It's a lead.

327
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,239
- Lead to what?
- To Heisenberg.

328
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,710
I told you it was only a matter of time
before this guy booted up again.

329
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,757
Here we go, my friend.

330
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,876
Don't hate me because I'm beautiful,
Gomey.

331
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,873
Just apologise and buy me a beer.

332
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,791
Man, you're reaching.

333
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,919
This stuff could be a knockoff
or left over from an older cook.

334
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,594
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

335
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,231
How do I know?

336
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,991
Because I know.

337
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,513
I don't get it.

338
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,877
This is the reason why
you're blowing off the task force?

339
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,837
Chase down teeners?

340
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,518
I'm getting tired
of all the second-guessing.

341
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,276
If you're not sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation...

342
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,590
...do us both a favour
and ask for a transfer.

343
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,035
What is up with you lately?

344
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,795
Starting bar fights,
turning down El Paso...

345
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,279
...and now this bullshit?

346
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,280
Do you need to talk to someone
or what?

347
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,598
Talk to someone?

348
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,958
Talk to who?

349
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,075
I'm not trying to step on your toes,
bro. Okay?

350
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,795
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

351
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,157
Appreciate that, bro.

352
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,389
Now take your hand off my shoulder.

353
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,192
Yeah, yeah, the one that was on TV.

354
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,238
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

355
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,278
I'm not looking for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

356
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,352
It could be a nut or a bolt.
It could be a bag of peanuts...

357
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,557
...just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

358
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,154
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.
Calling you back.

359
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,474
You had your chance.
I told you to get him cooking again.

360
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,349
You blew it off and now it's too late.
The guy's gone mass maniac on us!

361
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,750
All I wanted was to show you two
your potential.

362
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,115
And what do I get in return?
A bone contusion.

363
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,477
You wanna see the scar?
I wish you two had...

364
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,275
Hi, there.

365
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,876
- How in the hell did you get Walt to...?
- I made it.

366
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,191
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

367
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,598
Well, good news is...

368
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,912
...for a stage-three cancer,
the guy's doing well physically.

369
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,116
Mentally, the guy's a disaster.

370
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,670
He's gone off the rails
over this thing with his wife.

371
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,595
My opinion, he's not coming back.
Not on his own.

372
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,032
Your friends were at his place again,
by the way.

373
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,272
They drew something on the street
outside his house.

374
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,310
- The scythe.
- Animals.

375
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,072
- Does the lawyer know?
- Should he?

376
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,798
No.

377
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,679
If you want this guy to produce again,
why not just tell him?

378
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,149
You stand between him
and an axe in the head.

379
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,754
I don't believe fear
to be an effective motivator.

380
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,751
I want investment.

381
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,431
For now, I'm simply interested
in time frame.

382
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,398
He will live for the foreseeable future,
yes?

383
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,960
Foreseeable. Couple years at least,
barring acts of God and men with axes.

384
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,595
From the lawyer,
I'm supposed to let you know...

385
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,354
...the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

386
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,956
- I don't work with junkies.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

387
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,872
Probably for the best.

388
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,315
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

389
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,309
Really?

390
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,790
That's what Goodman says.
Cats and dogs.

391
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,838
Do the deal.

392
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,511
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

393
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,309
<i>Agent Schrader, you need to be calling</i>
<i>me back ASAP.</i>

394
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,995
<i>I've got Texas breathing down my neck</i>
<i>and I'm not about...</i>

395
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,235
No, I haven't see Matt since my dad
fired him, like, a while ago.

396
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,231
Where can I find him, you think?

397
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,278
- No idea. Haven't seen him.
- I know. You said that a few times.

398
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,831
Yeah, because I haven't seen him.
I don't know what else to say.

399
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,870
- What's your name, darling?
- Cara.

400
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,989
Where did this come from, Cara?

401
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,916
I don't know.

402
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,953
What is it? Drugs?

403
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,351
Look, I'm just gonna come right out
and say it.

404
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,280
You're a bad liar, Cara.

405
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,672
Don't get me wrong.
Not the worst I've... ever seen.

406
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,596
Once had a guy try to explain the dope
balloon up his butt on bad Thai food.

407
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,595
Still, you're not a very good liar.

408
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:09,192
- I honestly don't know...
- Stop.

409
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,397
You look like a good kid.
I'm not here to get you in trouble.

410
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,314
But you need to tell me
where this came from right now!

411
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,119
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

412
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,473
I tried it and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

413
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,551
- Okay, and who gave it to you?
- Some guy.

414
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,633
He came in a couple days ago
and wanted to trade it for gas.

415
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,712
Some guy? What's his name?

416
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:40,990
Okay, what...? What did he look like?

417
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,632
I don't know.

418
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,711
He looked pretty normal.

419
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,189
You know, white.

420
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,949
I think his hair was lightish brown.

421
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,995
He had really blue... eyes.

422
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,390
They were really, really blue.

423
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,199
Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreamy.
Okay, what else?

424
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,115
Piercings, jewellery, distinctive
articles of clothing. Come on.

425
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,592
Come on.

426
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,512
Listen to me.

427
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,355
It's real important that I find the person
that had these drugs.

428
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,717
So if you can remember
anything else...

429
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,672
Come on, think.
Come on, now. Come on.

430
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,038
He drove an RV.

431
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,153
Okay, good, good.

432
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,472
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

433
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,393
What colour?
Did you spot a license plate?

434
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,914
I don't know the kinds
and I didn't see the license.

435
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,840
But the colour was,
I think, white, brownish colour.

436
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,477
I'm sorry.

437
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,790
I know I'm not helping you...

438
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,189
...but, please, don't tell my dad.

439
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,719
Cara.

440
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,111
Please, tell me that
that camera works.

441
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,559
Damn it.

442
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,798
Bingo.

443
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,190
These... eggs are good, Mom.

444
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,114
Thanks.

445
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,232
Hey, you know what's weird?
Dad's website.

446
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,153
It's been three days
since the last donation.

447
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,434
Yeah, well, people lose interest.

448
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,593
So how long are you off for?

449
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,312
A few weeks.

450
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,195
I'll play it by ear.

451
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,636
I probably pushed it, you know,
going back to work too soon.

452
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,550
Think I can get a ride today?
Louis has a doctor's appointment.

453
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,919
Yeah.

454
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,668
Hey, so, Dad can babysit now, right?

455
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,473
You won't have to take Holly
to work every day.

456
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,318
Sometime, maybe.

457
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,998
Yeah, we'll see.

458
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,273
What's up?

459
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,593
I think you'll seriously enjoy, yo.

460
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,157
Wait. No, no. No way.

461
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,439
Hey! Hey!

462
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,473
Hey. What the hell? This is only half.

463
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,313
That's right. It's your half.

464
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,792
Yo, where's the other half, bitch?

465
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,912
I mean, the whole thing was crazy.
Poor bastard. I felt sorry for him.

466
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:02,868
I think he actually thought
we were the cable guys, you know.

467
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,354
Anyway, sorry about
those missed calls, chief.

468
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,590
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

469
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,475
Are you going to El Paso, Hank?

470
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,837
Hell, yes.
With pointy boots and bells on.

471
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,752
Got this break in the Heisenberg case.

472
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,753
The blue meth, you mean?
The teenth?

473
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,388
Yeah, well,
that teenth got things rolling.

474
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,757
I traced it to a gas station in Cibola.
That's where I got these.

475
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,435
The station's closed-circuit was down...
Surprise, surprise.

476
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:37,310
- But I was able to pull some of these
snapshots off an ATM security camera.

477
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,869
We always thought these guys
might be camper-cooking.

478
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,429
First off, your typical Class C
motor home...

479
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,398
...is gonna grunt at least 5000 pounds
of interior fixtures.

480
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,030
Appliances, furniture, built-ins,
5000 pounds at least, okay?

481
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,711
See how high
that suspension's riding?

482
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,313
No way, no how, this thing's carrying
that kind of weight.

483
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,155
This thing has been cleared out and
stripped down to its tight-and-curlies.

484
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,551
For what? Blood bank?

485
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,756
Maybe a bookmobile?

486
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,593
There's no clear view of the plates.

487
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,955
Yeah, well, you can only get
so lucky, right?

488
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,635
But there's no front plate. Tells me
it's likely New Mexico registration.

489
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,869
I check with DMV.

490
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,238
There are only 29 of these... early-'80s
Bounders registered in the state.

491
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,318
- Only 29?
- Yeah.

492
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,631
So I gotta go, you know,
knock on some doors.

493
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,752
They need you in El Paso, Hank.

494
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,509
You bet. I'm just gonna wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

495
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,035
- You're refusing the assignment.
- I'm not. I'll go.

496
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,997
It's just I need some more time.

497
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,879
You're not hearing me,
Agent Schrader.

498
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,872
You're out of time.

499
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,236
Are you going to El Paso now,
tonight?

500
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,395
It's a simple yes or no.

501
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,231
No. I can't.

502
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:21,079
But that's only because
I'm really close to something big here.

503
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,876
Better get to it, then.

504
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,111

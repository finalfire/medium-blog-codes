1
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,794
Think you'll be okay
waiting here by yourself?

2
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,353
Yeah, whatever.

3
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:27,115
Sir, if you'd like to smoke, you need
to be another 20 feet from the door.

4
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,192
So roll me further, bitch.

5
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,149
What's coming?

6
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,278
Male, Caucasian. Early 40s.
Multiple gunshot wounds.

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,720
BP is 70. Seven-zero over palp.

8
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,634
Pulse 140. One-four-zero.
Weak and thready at the brachial.

9
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,155
No breath sounds on the right side,
belly is rigid.

10
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,709
Appears pale and diaphoretic.
How many entry wounds?

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,075
Four. Shoulder and hip,
through and through.

12
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,710
Right lung in lower left quadrant,
no visible... exit wounds.

13
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,359
Let's get him 2 grams of oxygen.

14
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,750
- What's his haemoglobin?
- Seven-point-three.

15
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,279
Need two large-bore IVs,
six units O-neg.

16
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,193
Type and cross for six more units,
chest x-ray and KUB.

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,113
Notify the OR, we are on the way.

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,873
OR 1 is clear. Let's put him in there.

19
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,308
Yo, Jesse, sorry I'm late, man.

20
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,311
Damn, brother, look at you.

21
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,550
That's messed up.

22
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,115
How are you feeling? You okay?

23
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,078
Actually...

24
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,916
...I'm great.

25
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,877
I don't understand.

26
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,110
I thought things
were going pretty well.

27
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,870
I thought we were kind of simpatico.

28
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,555
You know?
We were becoming a real team.

29
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,950
Not... Not so much, no.

30
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,353
Is this about the temperature setting?
I can assure you that will not happen...

31
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,272
No, it's bigger than that, Gale.

32
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,069
It's much more than that.

33
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,034
Could you elaborate?

34
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,589
Well, yes, of course I could...

35
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,275
...but I don't think either of us...

36
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,159
...would necessarily benefit
from a prolonged...

37
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,118
Yeah, so...

38
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,395
Yeah.

39
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,028
I set up the... entire lab.

40
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,471
You said you liked the configuration.

41
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,312
And I do.

42
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,512
For the most part.

43
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,397
Look, you're a fine chemist, really,
with a promising future.

44
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,597
It's just that I...

45
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,518
That we just have different rhythms,
Gale.

46
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,954
You see... It's...

47
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,673
It's as if I'm classical...

48
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,153
...but you are more jazz.

49
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,798
- Jazz.
- Jazz. Yes.

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,599
And God knows
there is nothing wrong with jazz.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,233
It's simply that I require...

52
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,994
- Classical.
- Exactly.

53
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,915
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,998
Man, this is the bomb.

55
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,836
What's up, partner?

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,231
- I can't believe this.
- My replacement?

57
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,356
Oh, Jesus.

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,909
Hi. Gale.

59
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,157
- Nice to meet you.
- What's up?

60
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,754
Man. We should've ditched that RV
months ago.

61
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,354
It's all, like, shiny up in here.

62
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:56,799
I'm sorry, I must be missing something.
I don't mean... I don't mean to be...

63
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,832
- This...
- No.

64
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,549
- Makes no sense.

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,277
So I guess this is...

66
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,909
Oh, dear mother of God.

67
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,076
This is for the best.

68
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,992
Two hundred pounds a week. Got it?

69
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,959
Yeah.

70
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,190
Oh, man.

71
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,031
Mr. White.

72
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,597
Okay, there's a lot to show you.

73
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,955
Some new techniques to learn.

74
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,396
- What, now?
- Yes, now.

75
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,438
We've only got a couple days
before our next batch is due.

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,238
And I need to get you up to speed.

77
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,110
Right on. I'm just saying...

78
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,076
How's the cell service down here?

79
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,798
It's nonexistent.

80
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,359
We're shielded.

81
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,750
There's a hard line for emergencies.
Come on.

82
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,036
So you haven't talked
to anybody today...

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,714
...other than, you know,
Captain Nerd there.

84
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,909
Why?

85
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,632
Your brother-in-law.

86
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,959
What about him?

87
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,276
- What's the story?
- He was unresponsive.

88
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,476
You getting exposure
on those wounds?

89
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,631
- Two units of normal saline.
- Bivalve mass.

90
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,633
Breath sounds bilaterally.
Femur's like a wet bag of gravel.

91
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,189
Other one's not much better.
Get those boots off.

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,318
See if you get a pulse.
Get blood-pressure cup or an ABI?

93
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,549
Where's that blood?

94
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,549
<i>Dr. Bording to Cardiology.</i>

95
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,995
<i>Dr. Bording to Cardiology.</i>

96
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,270
- Sir, can I help you?
- Yeah, I...

97
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,829
- It's all right. He's family.
- Thank you.

98
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,235
Marie. I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, honey.

99
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,349
I'm so sorry.

100
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,030
I don't know what to say.

101
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,716
- How is he?
- I don't know.

102
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,678
They won't really tell us anything.
He's still in surgery.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,468
They shot him four times.

104
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,311
Oh, Christ.

105
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,916
- Where's Holly?
- I got a sitter.

106
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,312
- Hey, how are you, huh?
- Fine.

107
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,913
Yeah?

108
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,038
Sure?

109
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,151
I'm fine. I just need some fresh air.

110
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,432
Okay.

111
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,878
- Here. Let me get the door.
- I got it. I'm fine.

112
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,839
Walt. Walt, this is ASAC Merkert.
Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

113
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,952
- Hello.
- I'm very sorry.

114
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,394
Thank you.

115
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,791
Can you tell us anything
or any details?

116
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,428
Right now, all we know
is two men ambushed Hank.

117
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,478
They didn't have any ID on them.
Probably Mexican nationals.

118
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,915
Their tattoos indicated an affiliation
with the drug cartel.

119
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,151
Why did they attack Hank?

120
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,719
We're not sure yet.

121
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,759
It could be in relation to a investigation
Hank was working...

122
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,198
...or it could be a message
to the DEA in general.

123
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,839
They had an axe.

124
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,116
The cartels tend to be dramatic.

125
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,029
Jesus.

126
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,717
- Where are they? I mean, did they...?
- Hank got both of them.

127
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,429
He killed one outright, the other one's
upstairs in critical condition.

128
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,149
Your brother-in-law's one tough
son of a bitch to take them both out...

129
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,880
...considering
he didn't even have his gun.

130
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,595
He didn't have his gun?

131
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,597
Why didn't Hank have his gun?

132
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,389
Marie, the assault charge.

133
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,233
I had to suspend Hank
pending the investigation.

134
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,233
That means
I had to take away his weapon.

135
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,879
You had to take it.

136
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,793
- It's standard procedure. No one...
- Okay. All right, listen.

137
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,351
If you all listened to him from the start
and let him arrest that degenerate...

138
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,954
...he wouldn't have taken things
into his own hands.

139
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,714
And he would've had a gun
and could've defended himself.

140
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,075
- Marie, let's just...
- No. Just...

141
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,832
It's their fault.

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,956
He didn't have a gun.

143
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,076
Honey, this isn't helping you.

144
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,832
You.

145
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,875
What kind of partner are you?

146
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,590
You were supposed to back him up,
and where were you?

147
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,557
Where were you?

148
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,517
Texas.

149
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,513
And you.

150
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,717
You're supposed
to protect your agents...

151
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,871
...instead of taking their guns...

152
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,759
...not supporting them,
not backing them up.

153
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,353
- Marie. Marie.
- When they...

154
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,911
Honey, let's just go and sit down,
okay?

155
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,712
I'm not doing anything until these two
get the hell out of here. I mean it.

156
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,793
- Sorry...
- Go.

157
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,799
You are not welcome here.

158
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:37,158
- The DEA is not welcome here.
- Okay, honey.

159
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,435
Come on.

160
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,875
Come on. Let's go sit down.

161
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,916
It's not just them.

162
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,834
It's you, Walt.

163
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,236
This Pinkman
that Hank was looking for...

164
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,198
...Hank would have never
even heard his name...

165
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,955
...if you hadn't bought marijuana
from him.

166
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,918
- Marie...
- Do you ever think about that, Walt?

167
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,718
Do you?

168
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,918
Do you think about everything
that you have put him through?

169
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,071
Marie, stop.

170
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,238
You're upset, and you're looking
for someone to blame...

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,039
...and it's understandable,
but don't blame Walt.

172
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,589
It's not his fault.

173
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,351
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

174
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,239
- Sweetheart...
- No. No. Don't...

175
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,197
- It's okay.
- It's Hank.

176
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,032
It's all right.

177
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,360
All right, you're done.

178
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,636
Okay, next.

179
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,078
Hello.

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,992
Hello, hello, hello.

181
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,793
Yeah.

182
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,230
Yo, yo, yo.
Jesse Pinkman in the house.

183
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,389
Oh, my dear God.

184
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,794
<i>Walter White</i>
<i>to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

185
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,430
<i>Walter White,</i>
<i>please pick up a courtesy phone.</i>

186
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,516
<i>Yo, we working sometime this year?</i>

187
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,151
What the hell are you thinking?
Why are you calling me here?

188
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,788
Tried your cell
and it went straight to voicemail.

189
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,349
- How am I to get a hold of you?
- You aren't.

190
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,318
<i>It's been a whole day.</i>
<i>How long is this grieving process?</i>

191
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,072
Just put a clock on it for me.

192
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,994
<i>All I'm saying</i>
<i>is we have a schedule, right?</i>

193
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,628
My family
comes before your schedule.

194
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,756
<i>Dude, it's not my schedule.</i>

195
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,118
- We have responsibilities here.
<i>- I'll get there when I get there.</i>

196
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,110
You know what? Whatever.
I'll just cook on my own.

197
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,919
- You will do no such thing.
<i>- Why not?</i>

198
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,673
<i>Well, for starters...</i>

199
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,718
<i>...you aren't the least bit familiar</i>
<i>with any of the equipment.</i>

200
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,269
<i>There's gotta be some sort of manual,</i>
<i>right?</i>

201
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,160
- And I can read.
<i>- Jesse, touch nothing.</i>

202
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,436
<i>Stop treating me</i>
<i>lik e I'm lik e your assistant.</i>

203
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,036
I'm not your bitch to order around.
We're partners. Remember?

204
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,150
I need you to sit patiently and wait,
I will be there as soon as I can.

205
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,390
Thank you very much
for your kind words.

206
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,269
- We really do appreciate that.
- What, is your wife there?

207
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,271
<i>Yes. Yes, she is.</i>

208
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,954
She would be happy to know
you asked about her.

209
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,712
Please do keep us in your thoughts.

210
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,836
Hey, tell your douche bag
brother-in-law...

211
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,991
...to head towards the light.

212
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,234
So I'm thinking maybe we should go
get everybody some breakfast.

213
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,029
Yeah, that sounds good.
Do you know who that was?

214
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,239
You know,
these... eggs are really not too bad.

215
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,596
- Look at that.
- Look at what?

216
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,752
At what? This. These spots.

217
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,514
This fork is absolutely filthy.

218
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,797
Tell me you see this.
You've got good eyes. Look at that.

219
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,157
Marie, those are just water spots.

220
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,309
That's fine.

221
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,910
Those are not "water spots."

222
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,991
That's dirt.

223
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,357
This silverware's
obviously not been cleaned.

224
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,035
It's covered in germs
from someone... else's mouth.

225
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,350
God knows what.

226
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,195
Seriously, Aunt Marie,
it's water spots.

227
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,272
Ours at home aren't any better.

228
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,238
Yours at home are irrelevant.
We're in a hospital.

229
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,437
They need to be a higher standard.
They have a responsibility.

230
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,079
Well, I'm not actually sure...

231
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,994
...if the cafeteria necessarily qualifies
as being part of the hospital.

232
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,152
It's in the same building.
It's all under the same roof.

233
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,833
Do you think that sick people...

234
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,560
...aren't eating
with this bacteria-infested silverware?

235
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,757
My God, how are you supposed
to survive this death trap?

236
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,117
Marie...

237
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,393
I survived.

238
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,279
I had my lobectomy at this hospital.

239
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,032
Remember that?

240
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,309
Remember how scared we all were?

241
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,911
I didn't wanna act like it,
but I was terrified.

242
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,189
All that week, all I could think of...

243
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,797
...was how they were actually
going to cut me open...

244
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,952
...and take out a part of me...

245
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,157
...that was with me my entire life.

246
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,470
I couldn't get that image
out of my head.

247
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,959
I think the scariest part
was when they took me into pre-op.

248
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,076
Lying there,
waiting for them to anesthetise you.

249
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,468
Knowing that you may never
wake up again.

250
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,110
Actually what I really remember
about that day...

251
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,669
...is driving to the hospital.

252
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,559
Skyler, you remember me
wanting to drive that day?

253
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,832
Yeah.

254
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,675
Anyway, there we are.
We're driving up Central...

255
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,877
...and we hit every green light.

256
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,955
I mean,
every single light that we hit... green.

257
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,310
It's just... When does that happen?

258
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,675
Just like, bang, bang,
green the... entire way.

259
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,828
And the whole time,
all I could think about was:

260
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,199
"Why today? Why?
Why can't I just spend...

261
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:05,318
...a few extra minutes in the car
with my family?"

262
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,475
I never wanted to be stuck in traffic
so bad in my life.

263
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,594
At least I was with my family.

264
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,272
I had that.

265
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,396
Anyway, I survived this place.

266
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,437
And I'm not half the man
your husband is.

267
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,352
Yes?

268
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,636
<i>What the hell is going on up there?</i>

269
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,792
I was gonna ask you
the same question.

270
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,394
You know about my men?

271
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,075
<i>I heard that they attack ed a DEA agent.</i>
<i>Why would they do that?</i>

272
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,074
What's the matter?
Spanish not good enough anymore?

273
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,032
I didn't order this, and my men
would never do this on their own.

274
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,839
Someone gave the go-ahead.

275
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,190
<i>Are you accusing me?</i>

276
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,870
I'm just saying
they wouldn't act on their own.

277
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,032
I am not in the habit
of picking my own pocket.

278
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,277
I assume that the next shipment
will be delayed.

279
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,796
<i>- Any thoughts on when it might arrive?</i>
- A week, a month.

280
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,873
There's too much focus on the border.
We lay low for the time being.

281
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,110
We lay low,
and then we get the real story...

282
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,713
...from my man who survived.

283
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,599
Your man is in custody.

284
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,829
God bless America!

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,468
He's innocent until proven guilty.
Correct?

286
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,312
I'll get him the best lawyer...

287
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,436
<i>...and then we'll learn the truth.</i>

288
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,150
Well, keep me apprised.

289
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,989
Any time you got that close proximity
to the spine...

290
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,390
...there's always gonna be cause
for concern...

291
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,233
...but as I say,
it's really too soon to tell.

292
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,868
He's out of surgery, at least, which is...

293
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,237
- Out of surgery, on way to recovery.
- All right. And where's that?

294
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,356
Unfortunately, you can't see him yet.

295
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,590
We're gonna have to wait
for him to stabilize.

296
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,276
How long will that take?

297
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,431
I can't really say. It could be hours.

298
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,751
But we'll let you know
just as soon as you can see him.

299
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,873
Thank you.

300
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,359
Maybe we should get you home
for a couple hours?

301
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,431
Get some rest?

302
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,070
I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,069
Me neither.

304
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,554
Well, is anyone... else
dying to brush their teeth...

305
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,312
...or is it just me?

306
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,679
What if I ran over to the house
and picked up a few things?

307
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,308
Marie? I could swing by your place.

308
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,517
That would be great. Thanks, Walt.

309
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,793
Okay.

310
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,196
Walt. Walt.

311
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,316
We just heard he came through.

312
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,790
Yeah, well, it's, you know,
guardedly good news.

313
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,837
- Thank God. I'll take it.
- Yeah.

314
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,037
Hey, guys,
this is Hank's brother-in-law, Walt.

315
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,270
- Good to meet you. Hi.
- Hey.

316
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,830
- We were just swapping Hank stories.
- That could go on all day.

317
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,150
God knows,
there's a million of them.

318
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,036
- Meanwhile...
- Miserable piece of shit.

319
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,709
Guy who shot him, one that's left,
he's up there.

320
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,599
Got the painkillers going on,
resting comfortably.

321
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,273
Your tax dollars at work.

322
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,830
Gotta see what Hank did
to that bastard.

323
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,958
Wanna see?

324
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,634
Come on, let me show you.

325
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,551
You comfortable, you piece of shit?

326
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,754
- You got him?
- Come on.

327
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,236
- All right.
- Easy now, easy.

328
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,393
Come here.

329
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,959
No.

330
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,509
Oh, shit.

331
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,751
Oh, sheesh.

332
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,831
Oh, sheesh.

333
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,072
One for you and two for...

334
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,153
Yeah.

335
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,793
Finally. About damn time.

336
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,074
Why isn't there anything cooking?

337
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,511
<i>Walter White</i>
<i>to the nearest courtesy phone.</i>

338
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,870
<i>- Operator.</i>
- This is Walter White.

339
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,712
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

340
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,559
<i>Yo, we got problems, big ones.</i>

341
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,315
Reverend, so nice of you to call.
Again.

342
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,799
Turn your phone on already.

343
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,918
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I will definitely look into that.</i>

344
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,789
I'll tell you what. Why don't I just
call you right back on my cell phone?

345
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,313
Okay?

346
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,509
I told you to wait. I don't know
how many more ways I could say it.

347
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,557
<i>Yeah, dick, I was waiting...</i>

348
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,314
<i>...and then that creepy, quiet guy</i>
<i>showed up.</i>

349
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,115
- Gus came by?
- Not him, man.

350
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,510
Apparently
I'm not worthy of meeting him.

351
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,274
The other one.
The one I'm qualified to speak to.

352
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,919
He started asking questions too.

353
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,914
<i>Lik e why haven't we cook ed anything.</i>
<i>All right, we have a quota.</i>

354
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,516
It's due tomorrow.
Do you seriously not care or what?

355
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,478
<i>Because that guy,</i>
<i>he's got, lik e, the dead eyes.</i>

356
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,834
Let me ask you something.

357
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,639
Do you remember when we were
out in the desert with Tuco?

358
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,917
Oh, you mean when he put
a machine gun to my head?

359
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,753
Yeah, I think that does ring a tiny bell.
Why?

360
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,309
No. He kept... He kept saying...

361
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,995
...that someone was coming up
from Mexico to get us.

362
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,594
Do you remember?
Now, who was that?

363
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,912
What the hell has this got to do with...?
Look, I don't know. It was...

364
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,558
His cousins.

365
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,871
Right, Jesse? It was...
It was his cousins.

366
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,474
Yeah, cousins.

367
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,153
Whatever, man. Why?

368
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,879
Any news?

369
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,792
No change.

370
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,312
Okay, well, I didn't know
whose toothbrushes were whose...

371
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,358
...so I just stopped by the drugstore.

372
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,837
Thank God for travel sizes, right?

373
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,399
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

374
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,393
Yeah.

375
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,920
Oh, I think I'm gonna
go wash my face.

376
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,036
I'm going crazy.

377
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,918
- Do you wanna come?
- Yeah.

378
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,396
<i>Nurse Franklin,</i>
<i>please page the operator.</i>

379
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,994
<i>Nurse Franklin, page the operator.</i>

380
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,750
I got candy bars.

381
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,832
Is this what you were asking for?

382
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,956
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

383
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,271
Yeah, I skimmed through it.

384
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,715
- Looks interesting.
- Yeah.

385
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,909
Uncle Hank gave it to me.

386
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,836
Well, what's it about?

387
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,036
Pablo Escobar,
this big drug guy in the... 80s.

388
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,158
Yeah. Yeah.
I remember seeing him on the news.

389
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,116
Well, it's more about the guys
who investigated him...

390
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,630
...and tried to bring him down.

391
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,678
Some of them were DEA, you know?

392
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:18,830
Uncle Hank said
that they were worth learning about...

393
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,959
...that everybody knows
who Pablo Escobar is...

394
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,669
...but nobody knows about the guys
that brought him down.

395
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,595
I guess I never thought about it.

396
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,318
He said that good guys never get ink
like the bad guys do.

397
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,838
So he gave it to me.

398
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,555
Figured I'd read it.

399
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,876
I need to...

400
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,951
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

401
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,678
No, I assure you.
We are hard at work. Absolutely.

402
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,351
<i>So I can expect delivery by tomorrow</i>
<i>as scheduled.</i>

403
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,473
Well...

404
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,918
Unfortunately...

405
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,718
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

406
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,873
<i>...we're not going to be able</i>
<i>to k eep our schedule this week.</i>

407
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,156
But not for lack of trying.

408
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,276
Is there something I should know?

409
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,149
Well, to be completely honest
with you...

410
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,315
...Gale really screwed us up.

411
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,359
I mean, not on purpose, of course,
but he just... He set us way back.

412
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,159
And we've been playing catch-up
ever since.

413
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,513
And I've had to be out
running errands...

414
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,910
<i>...and trying to k eep us on target.</i>

415
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,239
Some of the... equipment
wasn't calibrated correctly...

416
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,233
Well, it's just all very technical
and boring.

417
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,392
But rest assured that...

418
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,755
That we will do whatever it takes.

419
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,118
<i>It has my total attention.</i>

420
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,396
<i>We'll cook through week end</i>
<i>if necessary.</i>

421
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,352
We will have 400 pounds for you
by next week.

422
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,438
I have your word on that?

423
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,956
You do. You have my word on that.

424
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,435
<i>Thank you for the update.</i>

425
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,833
Yeah. Right.

426
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,553
Any news?

427
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,474
No, I'm just wandering.

428
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,796
- How's everybody doing?
- Well, as well as can be... expected.

429
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,872
It's this not knowing...

430
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,349
...that's the hardest part, I think.

431
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,029
Anything new on these guys?

432
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,111
Who they are? What they wanted?

433
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,034
No, nothing yet, but we'll get it.

434
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,712
Steve...

435
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,358
Do you think
there could maybe be others?

436
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,392
Buddy, nobody's getting to Hank.

437
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,790
That was their one shot
and they blew it.

438
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,155
So no.

439
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,638
No way.

440
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,273
Jesus.

441
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,876
I'd love to walk in there and shoot
that bastard right in the head.

442
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,598
Me too.

443
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,113
Yeah?

444
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,834
Oh, yeah?

445
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,434
Great. We'll be right down.

446
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,828
Food's here.

447
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,877
Hey, you like Pollos Hermanos?

448
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,508
- You guys coming?
- Yeah.

449
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,193
- On occasion, yeah.
- Owner's a big booster for the DEA.

450
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,557
He heard what happened. He's gonna
feed every cop in the building.

451
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,189
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

452
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,193
And, apparently,
he's bringing it by personally.

453
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,238
- I don't even know what to say.
- That's an incredible...

454
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,960
- Good, huh?
- Delicious.

455
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,918
That's so generous of you.
Thank you very much.

456
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,355
Yes, thank you.
Guys, did you hear that?

457
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,114
Mr. Fring is offering
a 10,000-dollar reward...

458
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,236
...on any information about the case.

459
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,029
Well, that's... That's wonderful.

460
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,111
Wow, thank you, Mr. Fring.

461
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,794
You're very welcome.
Men like your husband...

462
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,679
...are thin blue line
between us and these animals.

463
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,159
I only wish I could do more.

464
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,591
Well, we do appreciate your support.

465
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,038
This reward could turn the tide here.
It'll really help.

466
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,997
Again,
I can't express how sorry I am.

467
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,310
As it happens,
I actually met Agent Schrader.

468
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:30,354
- Really?
- Our fund run, couple of months ago.

469
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,353
Mr. Fring was one of our sponsors.

470
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,951
I talked for a few minutes
with your husband.

471
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,837
As a matter of fact,
Mr. White, your name came up.

472
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,313
Really?

473
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,789
Yeah, there happened to be
a collection jar out for you...

474
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,633
...and we spoke briefly
about your health concerns.

475
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,712
I hope that there's been good news.

476
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,550
Things have improved, yes.

477
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,870
That's wonderful to hear.

478
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,278
It was clear to me
how deeply he cares for you.

479
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,239
Well, I have taken up
enough of your time.

480
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,917
Thank you again very much.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.

481
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,036
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

482
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,231
- Let me walk you out.
- Oh, no, it's not necessary.

483
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,513
You know, I didn't say thank you.

484
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,478
I'll walk him out. Be right back.

485
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,836
Good to see you.
Enjoying the chicken?

486
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,594
- Good. Good... Hey.
- Excuse me.

487
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,991
My pleasure. My pleasure, yeah.

488
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,639
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

489
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,597
It's good chicken, huh? Yeah. Good.

490
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,830
- Mr. Fring.
- Mr. White.

491
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,231
- I just wanted to thank you again.
- It's my pleasure.

492
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,279
May I...? May I speak with you?
Just a moment.

493
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,112
You knew.

494
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,796
You knew my brother-in-law
was with the DEA.

495
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,073
I investigate... everyone
with whom I do business.

496
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,750
What careful man wouldn't?

497
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,637
He is not a problem for us,
for our business.

498
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,589
Your being here is...

499
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,950
Is this some sort of message?

500
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,350
I'm supporting my community.

501
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,159
I hide in plain sight, same as you.

502
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,038
- Are we done?
- No, listen, I...

503
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,431
This attack on my brother-in-law,
I don't understand it.

504
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,431
I don't know what it means.

505
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,556
Please,
if you have some knowledge...

506
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,870
...that you could share with me...

507
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,396
I fear for my family.

508
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,914
I'm sure they'll be fine.

509
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,710
I am told the assassin that survived
is gravely injured.

510
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,950
It's doubtful he'll live.

511
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,873
Now thank me and shake my hand.

512
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,878
- Thank you. Thank you again.
- You're quite welcome, Mr. White.

513
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,034
Did you hear that?

514
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,115
- We're going up?
- Come on.

515
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,112
What's going on?

516
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,592
What's happening?

517
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,276
Starting chest compressions.
One, two, three, four.

518
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,159
- One, two, three...
- Defib?

519
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,118
Patient is in asystole.
Continuing chest compressions.

520
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,119
One, two, three, four.

521
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,589
- Give me a litre of saline.
- I can't get a pulse.

522
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,234
One, two, three, four.

523
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,472
- Still nothing.
- All right, stopping compressions.

524
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,835
- Time?
- Eight forty-three.

525
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,956
Time of death, 20:43.

526
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,912
Burn in hell, you piece of shit.

527
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,472
Yes? Juan?

528
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,312
<i>I assume you heard the news.</i>

529
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,040
Your man died. I heard.

530
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,668
- It's unfortunate.
<i>- Yeah, unfortunate.</i>

531
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,593
And meanwhile, I have Federales
surrounding my house.

532
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,309
You know what I think, Gustavo?
I think you're behind all this.

533
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,677
Why would I do this?

534
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,912
- How would it see... me?
- That's the part I'm trying to figure out.

535
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,150
Go off on your own, maybe.

536
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,237
Would you actually think
that would work?

537
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,039
<i>Juan, you sound lik e</i>
<i>you're under a lot of stress.</i>

538
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,078
You should call me back when
you're seeing things more clearly.

539
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,798
I see things clear enough.

540
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:01,396
One DEA gets shot,
all of Washington starts barking.

541
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,596
D.F. Suddenly has to put
on a big show...

542
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,399
<i>...and I wind up with Federales</i>
<i>in my rosebushes.</i>

543
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,198
<i>But just for a while.</i>

544
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,229
Appearances, politics.

545
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,353
<i>Are you still there, Gustav o?</i>

546
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,078
Yes.

547
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,475
I'm here.

548
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,078
<i>I'll weather this. I always do.</i>

549
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,719
My brother's a police chief.

550
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,394
I got connections.
They'll get me through.

551
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,676
And when I get proof...

552
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,559
...and the others find out
what you've done...

553
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,634
...maybe we come pay you a visit.

554
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,552
<i>Maybe we can...</i>

555
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,233
Skyler. Skyler. Marie. Marie.

556
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,075
Oh, how is he?
Tell me something good.

557
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,471
I think he's stable... enough now
for you to go see him briefly.

558
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,995
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid it's immediately family only.

559
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,071
- We're all family.
- I understand.

560
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,118
But we have a certain protocol here
that we need...

561
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,635
We're all family.

9999

1
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,717
Surprised he doesn't
make us do that.

2
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,470
The pack totally has a pecking order.

3
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,235
And the head hyena,
he's the man, you know.

4
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,834
All the other ones have to,
like, kiss his ass.

5
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,036
I mean, literally. It's so gross.

6
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,272
They have to lick his junk.

7
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,796
I can't believe
they even showed it on TV.

8
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,510
Yo, if this is supposed to be all,
like, major-league and all...

9
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,310
...we should have... equipment
maintainer guys.

10
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,630
And water boys, you know?

11
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,357
Yo, Gatorade me, bitch.

12
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,037
Get us a couple flunkies in here.

13
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,078
Treat us right.

14
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,953
Okay, 15 hours starts now.

15
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,350
I'm gonna hit it,
if that's cool with you.

16
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,114
- I don't understand.
- What?

17
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,316
These numbers,
they just don't add up.

18
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,630
Told you. Dude's totally boning us.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,360
No, it's not that.

20
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,196
It's our output. We're off.
We're.14 percent off.

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,433
Point one-four. That's, what, like...?

22
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,999
What does that mean?

23
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,709
It means we should be netting
more than we're netting.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,312
So how far off are we?

25
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,789
It's not negligible.

26
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,154
Ball-parking at it, I'd say
we're a quarter to a half a pound shy.

27
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,949
That's weird.

28
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,953
Well, what about spillage?

29
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,115
Spillage?

30
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,350
You know, when,
like, just stuff gets spilled.

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,398
Nothing gets spilled.

32
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,754
A little maybe.

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,478
Nothing gets spilled.

34
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,837
What about evaporation?

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,155
It wouldn't account for this much.
The materials aren't out that long.

36
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,038
What about the other one?

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,919
The drops, like on...

38
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,958
Like on, like, cold beer.

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,475
- Condensation?
- Yeah.

40
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,159
No.

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,233
Well, what about the crap
that gets left behind?

42
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,198
You know, all the gunk
we scrape out of the vats.

43
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,591
Gotta add up to like a gallon each.

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,876
Did you work that in?

45
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,756
- Vestiges.
- Yeah. Vestiges.

46
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,318
Bet that's it.

47
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,755
Bet that's totally it.

48
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,593
Hey, Mr. White.

49
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,077
Mr. White.

50
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,432
Are you okay?

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,151
Yeah. Yeah, why?

52
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,238
Nothing.

53
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,114
Are you coming?

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,836
Yeah, in a minute.

55
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,311
All right, see you tomorrow.

56
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,117
All right.

57
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,431
Shit.

58
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,038
Bastard.

59
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,356
Son of a...

60
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,318
Come on, you...

61
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,232
Come on, come on.

62
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,551
Son of a...

63
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,755
Come on.

64
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,470
Son of a bitch.

65
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,638
That's great.

66
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,358
All right.

67
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,956
You little bastard.

68
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,109
Shut the door!

69
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,114
- My ears are popping.
- Shut the door. Move.

70
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,919
Feels like on an airplane.
What the hell's doing that?

71
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,196
Positive pressure.

72
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,993
Positive what?

73
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,434
God, it frigging kills, yo.

74
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,194
- Well, just move your jaw around.
- I am moving it around.

75
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,396
- It's not working.
- Just yawn or something.

76
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,238
Stop acting like such a baby.

77
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,399
Damn.

78
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,835
What positive? Positive what?

79
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,074
Pressure. I've turned the ventilation up
to keep the outside out.

80
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,357
There's been a contamination.

81
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,750
Wait. What?

82
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,751
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hold up.

83
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,797
Something got into the lab.

84
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,394
So, what do we do?

85
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,675
I mean, do we...?

86
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,354
Wait. Wait. I mean,
shouldn't we be wearing masks?

87
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,115
No, no, it's not that kind
of contaminant.

88
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
So it's, like, not dangerous?

89
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,833
Mr. White, talk to me here.

90
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,075
Not to us particularly, no.

91
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,668
What the hell is that?

92
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,310
This is...

93
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,152
I made it.

94
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,593
So exactly what kind of contaminant
are we dealing with here?

95
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,318
A fly.

96
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,593
What do you mean?

97
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,274
A fly, like... Like, what do you mean?

98
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,069
I mean, a fly. A housefly.

99
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,471
Like one fly?

100
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,194
Singular?

101
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,038
- What did it do?
- It got into the lab.

102
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,270
I'm trying to get it out.
Okay? Understand?

103
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,552
No, man, not really. I can't say that
I'm really following you here.

104
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,079
Dude, you scared the shit out of me!

105
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,151
When you say it's contamination,
I mean...

106
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,515
...I'm thinking like an Ebola leak
or something.

107
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,715
Ebola.

108
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,348
Yeah, it's a disease
on The Discovery Channel...

109
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,478
...where all your intestines sort of
just slip out of your butt.

110
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,074
Thank you. I know what Ebola is.
Now, tell me.

111
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,870
What would a West African virus
be doing in our lab?

112
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:34,231
So you're chasing around a fly
and in your world, I'm the idiot.

113
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,518
Jesse, listen.

114
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,719
This fly...
No, any fly cannot be in our lab.

115
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,916
It's a problem. It's a contamination.

116
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,356
And that is in no way a misuse
of the word. Okay?

117
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,277
So in terms of keeping our cook clean
and our product unadulterated...

118
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,715
...we need to take this very seriously.

119
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,518
Now do you understand?

120
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,591
So is that your fly-sabre?

121
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,319
This is a swatter.

122
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,074
And it happens to work quite well,
thank you.

123
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,437
Hey, what happened to your head?

124
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,033
Nothing. I'm fine.

125
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,112
You didn't hit it,
like really, really hard?

126
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,398
My head is not the problem, Jesse.
The fly is the problem.

127
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:28,868
You didn't happen to maybe try
our product, did you?

128
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,555
Jesse, I know this seems unusual
to you, a layman.

129
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,152
A fly. I get it.
It seems insignificant, right?

130
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,393
But trust me, in a highly controlled
environment such as this...

131
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,113
...any pollutant...

132
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,955
...no matter how small...

133
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,595
...could completely...

134
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,989
Hello?

135
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,708
What?

136
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,678
Were you here all night?

137
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,518
Have you even slept?

138
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,114
No. Jesse, look. I'm fine, okay?

139
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,475
Will you just please focus on...?

140
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,198
Okay, look, we're running late,
so let's just get started.

141
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,396
The sooner we do it,
the sooner we're done.

142
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,199
Fricking finally.

143
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,399
What are you doing?

144
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,551
It's time to alkaline.

145
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,757
Have you not heard a word I said?

146
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,037
No cooking until this fly
is dealt with.

147
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,395
Have I been speaking to myself?

148
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,755
The timer went off, yo.

149
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,912
How long is this batch gonna be
good for? An hour? Two?

150
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,755
The batch will be good for nothing
if we don't clear the contaminant.

151
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,876
"Clear the contaminant."

152
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,508
We're making meth here, all right?
Not space shuttles.

153
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,195
We're making nothing until
we catch this fly.

154
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,475
What fly? All right?

155
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,189
Where the hell is this fly?
Not like I even seen the thing.

156
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,591
Maybe your positive pressure blew it
out the door or something.

157
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,399
No, no, it is here. It is around, okay?

158
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,191
He's around, and I am not going
to expose this batch...

159
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,510
...to the open air and contamination,
period.

160
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,036
Now, you can leave me to deal with
this myself or you can help me.

161
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,270
But you are right.
We're running out of time.

162
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,954
So I need your answer right now.

163
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,993
Okay.

164
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,438
Hey, tick-tock, yo.

165
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,316
Look, I like making cherry product,
but let's keep it real, all right?

166
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,473
We make poison for people
who don't care.

167
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,313
We probably have the most un-picky
customers in the world.

168
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,994
No, no, no. No rationalizing.

169
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,118
We'll find it any minute.
Don't give up.

170
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,073
Did you know that there's
an acceptable level of rat turds...

171
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,277
...that can go into candy bars?

172
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,639
That's the government, Jack.

173
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,148
Even the government doesn't care
that much about quality.

174
00:16:53,720 --> 00:17:00,068
You know what is okay to put
in hotdogs, huh?

175
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,993
Pig lips and assholes.

176
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:09,235
But I say, hey, have at it, bitches,
because I love hotdogs.

177
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,234
- And, you know, see what I'm try...?
- What are you doing?

178
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,119
Oh, hey.

179
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,318
Look, let me just top it off,
all right, really quick.

180
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,948
You know, a little sodium hydroxide,
shut the lid.

181
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,588
No harm done. Then we're golden.

182
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,590
It stays closed. That's an order.

183
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,830
You can't order shit, Adolf, all right?
We're 50-50 partners, remember?

184
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,871
God, what is your problem?

185
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,438
Freaking psycho.

186
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,876
- Jesse.
- Oh, God.

187
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,759
- It, like, hit bone.
- Jesse.

188
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,478
Jesse.

189
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,676
You see it, right?

190
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,118
You see it?

191
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,838
Yeah.

192
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,832
Get it.

193
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,312
You want me to get it?

194
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,159
Yes.

195
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,552
Slow. Move slowly.

196
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,678
I know. I'm moving slowly, yeah.

197
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,071
Absolutely. I'm just gonna need
your swatter thing.

198
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,593
Come on.

199
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,634
Oh, yeah. It's okay, come on.

200
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,392
Yeah.

201
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,878
- Yeah, come on.
- Just make it count.

202
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,794
Yeah, no, no, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna make it count, all right.

203
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,635
Okay. Now, on three.

204
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,153
Okay.

205
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,429
One...

206
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,878
Motherfuck...!

207
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,272
Yeah. You like that, huh?
Hurts, huh?

208
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,800
- Did you get it?
- I think so, yeah.

209
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,394
- Where is it?
- I don't know. What does it matter?

210
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,357
Who cares? I got it.

211
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,751
- Oh, Jesus, seriously?
- Where is it?

212
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,676
It's right there. Look.

213
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,799
Look. See? I told you I got it.

214
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,475
This is a raisin.

215
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,550
Look, I definitely got it, man, all ri...

216
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,277
Oh, man.

217
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,439
He's got some skills, yo.

218
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,079
I'll give him that.

219
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,152
Look.

220
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,032
I feel like I'm running out of ways
to explain this to you...

221
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,351
...but once more, I shall try.

222
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,316
This fly is a major problem for us.

223
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,119
It will ruin our batch.

224
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,751
And we need to destroy it
and every trace of it so we can cook.

225
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,911
Failing that...

226
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,077
...we're dead.

227
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,079
There is no more room for error.

228
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,955
Not with these people.

229
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,999
All right, how about we go
get some air?

230
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,913
"Get some air"?

231
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,389
Your answer to,
"We're sliding headfirst...

232
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,949
...into a massive crap..."
- Hey, hey, hey, Mr. White.

233
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,237
All right, I understand that the fly
is a serious thing now.

234
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,549
All right? I'm on board.

235
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,757
I'm just saying, you know,
maybe if we went and got some air...

236
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,515
...it would help us come up with a plan
on how to catch it.

237
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,229
Then come back down here
and subtract his ass.

238
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,679
- Oh, wait, do you have your keys?
- Yeah.

239
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,593
You sure? Last thing we need
is to get locked out.

240
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,593
Yeah. Hey!

241
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,354
If you're not gonna help me,
stay out of my way!

242
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,953
Hey!

243
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,797
Yo, yo, does somebody have
an axe I can use?

244
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,680
There we go.

245
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,116
Say good night.

246
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,515
Son of a bitch!

247
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,991
Son of a...

248
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,992
Damn it.

249
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,316
Where in the hell is that...?

250
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,672
What the hell?

251
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,154
Need some juice maybe?

252
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,671
Knock yourself out.

253
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,034
It's a real one.

254
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,077
Yeah, like yours was working.

255
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,277
No, no, no.

256
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,351
Look, we're trying to decontaminate.

257
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
You don't decontaminate by
contaminating further.

258
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,276
What the hell is all this?

259
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,274
Here, how about this?

260
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,671
"Non-toxic glue strips."

261
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,991
Yeah, baby. It's got pheromones,
all right? I got a butt-Ioad.

262
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,470
We hang them up all over the place.
It won't be able to resist.

263
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,077
I sure hope we have... enough.

264
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,349
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say yeah.

265
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,678
Do you see him?

266
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,034
How long do you think
you've been awake?

267
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,918
Why do you keep asking me that?

268
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,471
Just figure, you know, you could use
some coffee, is all. I know I could.

269
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,437
How about it?

270
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,719
Yeah.

271
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,913
- You take cream and sugar?
- Black is fine.

272
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,669
Why don't you just leave him be?

273
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,990
Let the traps do the work.

274
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,188
These pheromones are supposed
to kick ass.

275
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,033
Bet we catch this mofo any second.

276
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,039
Thank you.

277
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,830
You ever have, like, a wild animal
trapped in your house?

278
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,192
Not that I can recall, no.

279
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:07,354
We did, this one time,
back when it was my aunt's house...

280
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,478
...back before she died of cancer.

281
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,596
It was a possum.
Big freaky-Iooking bitch.

282
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,638
Hey, since when did they change it
to "opossum"?

283
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,713
What's up with that? I mean, when
I was coming up, it was just "possum."

284
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,236
You know, "opossum" makes it sound
like he's Irish or something.

285
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,790
I mean, why they gotta go
changing everything?

286
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,269
Whatever. It's just big rats anyways.

287
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,228
Giant pink-tailed rats
with their pink rat faces.

288
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,076
Totally freaky, like alien rats.

289
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,957
Actually, it's not so much
that he got trapped...

290
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,113
...but he was living there,
you know, under the house.

291
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,317
You could hear him going from,
like, room to room...

292
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,392
...always scurrying around.

293
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,588
Sometimes I'd see him outside at night
and it would just, you know, freeze.

294
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,991
I mean, it's like you're not looking
right at it, right?

295
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,913
I mean, it thinks it's fooling you.

296
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,436
That's what they do.
I mean, they play dead or whatever.

297
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,160
It's just so lame.

298
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,472
Is there a discernible point
to this story?

299
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:24,359
A point that you'll be arriving at
sometime in the near future?

300
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,555
It was just a total bitch to get out.
You know, it took forever.

301
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,068
Guy came, set all these traps and all
and he finally got it.

302
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,711
But my aunt, you know,
she didn't believe it.

303
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,832
I mean, she kept insisting
she could still hear the thing.

304
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,719
I mean, you could not tell her
any different.

305
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,873
She started keeping an old umbrella,
you know, by her chair.

306
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,998
Man, she would just bang on the floor
and yell at it.

307
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,435
Even gave it a name.

308
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,195
It was Scrabble.

309
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,588
Yeah, that was it.

310
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,389
You know,
"Scrabble, just knock it off:"

311
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,628
She got like that toward the... end.

312
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,875
Got obsessive about stuff.
Just got mad about stuff.

313
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,435
We didn't know what was up.

314
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,158
It wasn't like her to be that way.

315
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,393
But it turned out that the cancer
had spread to her brain...

316
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,790
...and that was why.

317
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,355
It metastasised.

318
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,831
But it was good that that was when
we decided to take her to the doctor...

319
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,230
...because then we knew
what was up.

320
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,150
You know, got her some treatment.

321
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,990
Meds, so she wasn't stressing
all the time.

322
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,189
It was a lot better after that.

323
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,956
You know, she was a lot happier.

324
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,356
Where the hell is he?

325
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,877
I've been to my oncologist, Jesse...

326
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,792
...just last week.

327
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,309
I'm still in remission.

328
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,992
I'm healthy.

329
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,836
Okay, so good. Great.

330
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,835
Well...

331
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,075
...no end in sight.

332
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,235
That's great.

333
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,992
Well...

334
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,517
...I missed it.

335
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,438
There was some perfect moment
and it passed me right by.

336
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,711
I had to have... enough to leave them.

337
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,075
That was the whole point.

338
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,474
I mean, none of this...

339
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,196
None of this makes any sense
if I didn't have... enough.

340
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,712
But it had to be
before she found out. Skyler.

341
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,269
It had to be before that.

342
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,877
Perfect moment for what?

343
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,116
To drop dead?

344
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,395
What, you saying you wanna die?

345
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,317
I'm saying I've lived too long.

346
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,359
I mean...

347
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:02,672
...you want them to actually miss you,
you know?

348
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,917
You want their memories of you
to be...

349
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,471
But she just won't...

350
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,518
She just won't understand.

351
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:20,196
I mean, no matter how well
I explain it...

352
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,272
...these days, she just has this...

353
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,953
This...

354
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,920
I mean, I truly believe there... exists
some combination of words.

355
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,552
There must exist certain words
in a certain specific order...

356
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,840
...that would explain all of this,
but with her, I just...

357
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,793
I just can't ever seem to find them.

358
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:48,076
Mr. White,
how about you just sit down?

359
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,993
You know, I was thinking maybe
before the fugue state...

360
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,357
...but before the fugue state,
I didn't have... enough money.

361
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,876
So no, not then.

362
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:09,553
And plus,
my daughter wasn't born yet.

363
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,874
It had to be after Holly was born.

364
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,632
Mr. White...

365
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,473
Definitely before the surgery.

366
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,230
Oh, Christ.

367
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,636
That damn second cell phone.

368
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,268
I mean, how could I possibly...?

369
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,670
I know the moment.

370
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,353
It was the night Jane died.

371
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,470
Yeah, I...

372
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,436
I was at home
and we needed diapers...

373
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,151
...and so I said I'd go,
but it was just an excuse.

374
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,598
Actually, that was the night
I brought you your money, remember?

375
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,718
Yeah, I remember.

376
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,755
But afterward, I stopped at a bar.

377
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,956
It was odd.
I never do that, go to a bar alone.

378
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,669
I just walked in, sat down.

379
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,956
I never told you.

380
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,756
That you went to a bar?

381
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,193
No, I...

382
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,035
I sit down and this man,
this stranger...

383
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,395
...he... engages me in conversation.

384
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,471
He's a complete stranger.

385
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,833
But he turns out to be Jane's father,
Donald Margolis.

386
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,752
What are you talking about?

387
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,514
Of course, I didn't know it
at the time.

388
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,478
I mean, he was just some guy
in a bar.

389
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,679
I didn't put it together until after the
crash when he was all over the news.

390
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,751
Jane's dad.

391
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,639
I mean, think of the odds.

392
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,269
Once I tried to calculate them,
but they're astronomical.

393
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,991
I mean, think of the odds of me
going in, sitting down...

394
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,153
...that night in that bar
next to that man.

395
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,636
What did you talk about?

396
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,555
Water on Mars.

397
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,432
Family.

398
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,312
What about family?

399
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,999
I told him that I had a daughter
and he told me he had one too.

400
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,278
Then he said:

401
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,750
"Never give up on family."

402
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,351
And I didn't.

403
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,230
I took his advice.

404
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,872
The universe is random.
It's not inevitable.

405
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,998
It's simple chaos.

406
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,711
It's subatomic particles
in endless aimless collision.

407
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,553
That's what science teaches us.

408
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,390
But what is this saying?

409
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:46,752
What is it telling us when, on the very
night that this man's daughter dies...

410
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,591
...it's me who's having a drink
with him?

411
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,799
I mean, how can that be random?

412
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,680
Hey, come on. Hey, sit down.

413
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:02,957
No, no. No, it's...

414
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,718
No. No.

415
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,951
No, that was the moment.

416
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,151
That night.

417
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,713
I should never have left home.

418
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,754
Never gone to your house.

419
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,277
Maybe things would have...

420
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,070
Oh, thought I was...

421
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:51,753
I was at home watching TV.

422
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,392
It was some...

423
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,751
Some nature programme
about elephants.

424
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,956
And Skyler and Holly
were in another room.

425
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,511
I could hear them
on the baby monitor.

426
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,273
She was singing a lullaby.

427
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,910
If I had just lived right up
to that moment...

428
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,119
...and not one second more...

429
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,720
...that would have been perfect.

430
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,634
He's not coming down.

431
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,917
Must be Thailand-hot up there.

432
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,151
That's why he likes it.

433
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,749
Thailand's hot, right?

434
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,355
Yeah.

435
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,114
Then that's why.

436
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,277
- Oh, Jesus.
- Hey, hey, wait. Here.

437
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,394
He's not coming down.

438
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,555
He's staying up there forever.

439
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,875
What are you...? What are you doing?

440
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,555
What do you think?
I'm gonna get that bitch.

441
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,200
No, you're gonna break your neck.

442
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,635
Yeah, yeah. Just...

443
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,836
No, seriously, you're...
This is a bad idea.

444
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,791
Damn it.

445
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,473
Jesse.

446
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,755
Just hold onto it.

447
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,071
Hold it still?

448
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,991
Jesse.

449
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,833
I'm sorry.

450
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,709
Sorry for what, being a lunatic?

451
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,394
I'm sorry about Jane.

452
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,112
Yeah.

453
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,797
Me too.

454
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,392
I mean...

455
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,193
...I'm very sorry.

456
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,955
It's not your fault.

457
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,632
It's not mine... either.

458
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,873
It's no one's fault, not even hers.

459
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,394
You know, we are who we are,
Mr. White.

460
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,839
You know, two junkies
with a duffel bag full of cash.

461
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,631
Like you said, we both would've
been dead within a week.

462
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,316
But I miss her, though.

463
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,236
God, I do.

464
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,034
Jesse.

465
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,352
Come down.

466
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,751
Wait. I'm so close.

467
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,196
Let it go.

468
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,519
We need to cook.

469
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,271
What about the contamination?

470
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,274
It's all contaminated.

471
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,590
All right, well...

472
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,396
...I definitely scared him.

473
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,076
Probably stay out of our way.

474
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,713
Yeah!

475
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,275
Somebody got got, yo!

476
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,510
Did you see that, Mr. Wh...?

477
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,671
Bins are packed?

478
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,191
Bins are packed.

479
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,273
How's the yield?

480
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,749
Two-oh-two and change.

481
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,278
You okay getting home?

482
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,750
Yeah. Better. Thanks.

483
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,751
Mañana, then.

484
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,638
Jesse, come here.

485
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,676
I couldn't chance saying it inside.

486
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,435
For all I know,
the lab's wired for sound.

487
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,315
That half a pound
I said we were off by.

488
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:09,910
Now, I'm not accusing you, but if...

489
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,759
You understand?
And if they ever found out...

490
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,828
I didn't take shit.

491
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,030
I'm just saying that
I won't be able to protect you.

492
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,514
Who's asking you to?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

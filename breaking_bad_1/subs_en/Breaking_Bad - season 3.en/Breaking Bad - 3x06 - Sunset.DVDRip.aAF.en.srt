1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,759
<i>KDK-12, come in.</i>

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,990
<i>- KDK-12.</i>
- KDK-12.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,436
<i>Hey, Bobby,</i>
<i>need you to look in on Mrs. Peyk etewa.</i>

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,433
- She all right?
<i>- Her daughter called from California.</i>

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,637
<i>She hasn't heard from her in a while,</i>
<i>kind of worried.</i>

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,438
Will do.

7
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,234
Miss Peyketewa, hello.

8
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,993
Miss Peyketewa.

9
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,235
Miss Peyketewa.

10
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,033
KDK-12 here.
Janet, Jesus, we got a homicide.

11
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,077
<i>- Come again?</i>
- Miss Peyketewa, she's dead.

12
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,277
- I need some backup out here.
<i>- Okay. On their way.</i>

13
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,351
Whoever's in there,
show yourself right now!

14
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,675
Hold it right there.

15
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,114
Let me see your hands.

16
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,269
Hands!

17
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,635
All right, down.

18
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,074
On your knees.

19
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,068
You understand me?

20
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,515
Do you speak English?

21
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,390
I said, down. On your knees.

22
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,073
Down!

23
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,478
Damn it, get down.

24
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,834
On your knees.

25
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,228
Do it.

26
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,554
On your knees or I'll fire!

27
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,470
- Yeah?
<i>- I found the papers.</i>

28
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,791
<i>Right where you left them,</i>
<i>in the crib.</i>

29
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,791
Yeah, well...

30
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,190
You know best, right?

31
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,079
Anything else?

32
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,798
Do you have any thought...

33
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,353
...about how we're going
to approach this with Walter Jr?

34
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,158
<i>Well, he's still my son.</i>

35
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,276
<i>- I mean, he will remain...</i>
- Of course.

36
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,518
<i>My point being...</i>

37
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,871
...the divorce.

38
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,273
<i>Well, I...</i>

39
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,279
I think he gets it, don't you?

40
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,271
I mean, I...

41
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,749
I think he saw it coming.

42
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,951
He sees your unhappiness and...

43
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,872
<i>My unhappiness?</i>

44
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,032
<i>My completely out-of-the-clear...</i>

45
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,159
...blue-sky unhappiness?

46
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,912
<i>Really?</i>

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,079
Look, as you said, for the best.

48
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,549
Yeah.

49
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,312
Okay.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,798
Last thing and then I'll let you go.

51
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,797
<i>In the child support worksheet,</i>
<i>you list medical, dental...</i>

52
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,912
...child care, transportation, housing,
education, food, clothing.

53
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,513
That's right, all of it.

54
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,958
Walt.

55
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,310
- No.
<i>- Skyler, you wanted me out...</i>

56
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,199
...I'm out,
but I will provide for my family.

57
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,351
<i>Not with that money.</i>

58
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,478
You'd be making us accessories
after the fact.

59
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,189
How do you think we've been paying
our bills these last six months?

60
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,912
I have to go.

61
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,079
Yep, I was right.

62
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,629
Three units available,
exact same floor plan.

63
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,553
I can call over, get you in
to see any of the others.

64
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,312
No, no, this one's fine.

65
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,513
I'll take it.

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,713
Now, unfortunately,
this one is the model, so...

67
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,359
Yeah, I like it.

68
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,272
I like... everything about it.

69
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,273
I'll take it as-is.

70
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,595
Name one thing in this world
that is not negotiable.

71
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,995
- You have to clean the fryer.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,031
We try to clean them every night...

73
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,909
...but make sure it's off
before you open the intake valve.

74
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,119
Good. Now, I suggest that you add this
to your Monday maintenance schedule.

75
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,669
Yes, sir. Now, select freezing mode...

76
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,719
...clock button off, press and hold
auto-control until it beeps.

77
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,632
Main valve on, main switch on.

78
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,031
Give the compressor time
for the needle to enter the green.

79
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,676
You're for real?

80
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,195
- This is all you?
- All me.

81
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,430
Heisenberg who? That's what I say.

82
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,511
My man Jesse can cook.

83
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,319
Check it, yo.
It ain't cloudy or dirty or nothing.

84
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,710
- Just the right shade of blue.
- Good shade.

85
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,758
Check out that crystal size.
If that bitch was any bigger...

86
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,832
...it would be a Jolly Rancher.
- Be my guest.

87
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,758
You sure?

88
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,037
I feel kind of dickish
with you being in rehab and all.

89
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,512
No. I can watch, yo.

90
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,797
- I can cook and I can watch.
- Go for it.

91
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,030
I tried it last week.
I'm still coming down.

92
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,350
Go easy.

93
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,918
Okay.

94
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,908
<i>Riverdance.</i>

95
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,992
Hey, hey, stop marking up my floor,
dumb-ass. Come on.

96
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,879
Bow before me.

97
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,631
I am Lord of the Dance.

98
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,039
Shit.

99
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,599
I gotta try that again.

100
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,591
Yeah, no, I think you're good.

101
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,237
That is awesome, Jesse.

102
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,428
I feel like somebody took my brain out
and boiled it in, like, boiling hot...

103
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,591
It's the bomb, man, seriously.

104
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,830
Like anthrax.

105
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,232
Good.

106
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,118
So...

107
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,351
...you ready to talk some business?

108
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,317
You mean this is not, like,
just recreational?

109
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,837
I know...

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,877
...what you're thinking.

111
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,157
Trust me,
it's not gonna be like it was.

112
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,834
All right, never gonna be like it was.

113
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,275
- How's that?
- We sell it safe.

114
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,590
All right? We sell it smart.

115
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,877
We don't get greedy, like before.

116
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,431
I don't know, man.

117
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,352
Combo and all.

118
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,839
Still...

119
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,355
...man's gotta make his living.

120
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,232
If it's like Jesse says
and we're not greedy...

121
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,958
I mean...

122
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,917
...I guess I can see it.

123
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,117
Had a good thing going
before we started pushing our luck.

124
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,511
- Lf it can go back to being like that...
- Hey, it will be.

125
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,035
Step one, we build inventory.

126
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,599
Badger, go see Clovis.

127
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,038
Get the RV in shape, tune-up,
oil change, brake lights, and whatnot.

128
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,795
Cops always pull you over
for brake lights. Not us.

129
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,995
Cautious.

130
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,229
- Right on.
- You got it.

131
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,757
You know that buzzer thing?
Leave the key in the ignition, it buzzes?

132
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,832
Just have him put in
one of those too.

133
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,230
Skinny, you're in charge of supplies.

134
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,357
I'll get you a list.

135
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,953
Right on.

136
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,838
Yeah?

137
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,230
- Yeah.
- All right.

138
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,678
So...

139
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,398
...we good?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,549
Good?

141
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,995
- All right.
- Let's do this thing.

142
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,515
Brandon Mayhew.

143
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,636
I know you.

144
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,598
Small world, Albuquerque.

145
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,951
Wanna talk about it?

146
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,278
Why? It's not like I get a vote.

147
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,879
You know, ironically...

148
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,113
...I think you're gonna see
much more of me from now on.

149
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,269
Sure.

150
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,908
Well, just as much of me at least.

151
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,833
I'm taking you to the school,
to and from, every day.

152
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,355
What, I don't get a vote in this
either?

153
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,354
I gotta stop going with Louis
just because you're feeling guilty?

154
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,750
I do feel guilty.

155
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,238
I am the man that I am, son...

156
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,557
...and there's plenty
that I would change about that, but...

157
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:13,510
Here we are,
and this is just what it is.

158
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,518
You know what? Call me crazy...

159
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,196
...but I'm actually feeling very good
about the future.

160
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,799
Morning.

161
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,393
They're back.

162
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,791
I'm wondering if we should
maybe call the police or something.

163
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,359
Why?

164
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,590
They're doing nothing wrong.

165
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,392
Okay, let's put this on Table 33,
okay?

166
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,078
Hello there.

167
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,113
Mr. White, I presume?

168
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,233
Oh, yes. Hi.

169
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,753
L...

170
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,912
Sorry. I'll be right down.

171
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,919
- Hi. Gale Boetticher.
- Hi.

172
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,428
You're my new lab assistant,
I take it.

173
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,589
Yes, I am.

174
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,149
I suppose you'll wanna hear
my qualifications.

175
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,788
I have my résumé here for you.

176
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,633
I received my bachelor's degree
from UNM.

177
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
My master's
from the University of Colorado.

178
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,830
Organic chemistry
with a speciality in...

179
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,678
It's all right there.

180
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,957
"X-ray crystallography."

181
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,109
Really?

182
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,790
I could talk about that for hours.

183
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,234
I would love to.

184
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,836
But first, I'm curious about this.

185
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,595
That's a little pet project of mine.

186
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,517
See, in my opinion,
it's all about the quinic acid level.

187
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,434
You want just north of 4800 milligrams
per litre...

188
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,036
...but if you over-boil to get there,
you'll leach your tannins.

189
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,316
Bitterness, yuck.

190
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,755
So I pull a mild vacuum.

191
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,994
That way, I can keep the temperature
no higher than 92 C and...

192
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,873
Judge for yourself.

193
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,157
Oh, my God.

194
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,037
My God, that is the best coffee
I've... ever tasted.

195
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,437
Sumatran beans...

196
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,717
...and I also have to give credit
to the grind...

197
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,474
...but thank you, Mr. White.
- Walt.

198
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,631
Please, call me Walt.

199
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
Why the hell are we making meth?

200
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,191
Hey.

201
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,873
Tell me...

202
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,474
...with the phenylacetic acid
solution...

203
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,031
...you said 150 drops per minute
for the first 10 minutes...

204
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,749
...and then 90 for the remainder.
Why is that?

205
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,596
Well, my thinking is,
by tapering the phenyl...

206
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,196
...you get an oilier aqueous layer,
and hence...

207
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,998
Better benzene... extraction.

208
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,718
Exactly.

209
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,155
But actually, I prefer ether.

210
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,038
Oh, I'll have it for tomorrow.

211
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,355
Gale, I'm wondering how you...

212
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,317
Ended up here.

213
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,589
Well, actually, I'm still wondering
how I ended up here, but, yes.

214
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,550
I mean, I can't imagine
we strike... each other as criminals.

215
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,477
Well, there's crime
and then there's crime...

216
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,552
...I suppose.

217
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,472
I'm definitely a libertarian.

218
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,390
Consenting adults want
what they want...

219
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,916
...and if I'm not supplying it,
they will get it somewhere... else.

220
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,719
With me, they're getting exactly
what they pay for.

221
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,509
No added toxins or adulterants.

222
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,315
Yeah, I was doing it
the way you are supposed to...

223
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,234
...pursuing my doctorate at Colorado,
NSF research grant.

224
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,994
I was on my way,
jumping through hoops...

225
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,957
...kissing the proper behinds...

226
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,319
...attending to all the non-chemistry
that one finds oneself occupied by.

227
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,879
You know that world.

228
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,794
That is not what I signed on for.

229
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,675
I love the lab.

230
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,116
Because it's all still magic.

231
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,269
You know?

232
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,952
Chemistry?

233
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,552
I mean...

234
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,797
...once you lose that...

235
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,075
It is.

236
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,633
It is magic.

237
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,870
It still is.

238
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,514
And all the while, I kept thinking
about that great old Whitman poem:

239
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,433
"When I Heard
the Learn'd Astronomer."

240
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,833
I don't know it.

241
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,309
Anyway...

242
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,675
Well, can you recite it?

243
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,035
Pathetically enough, I could.

244
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,236
All right, well...

245
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,709
No, no, come on. Come on.

246
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,949
Yeah?

247
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,474
<i>When I heard the learn'd astronomer</i>

248
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,120
<i>When the proofs, the figures</i>
<i>Were ranged in columns before me</i>

249
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,919
<i>When I was shown the charts</i>
<i>And the diagrams</i>

250
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,640
<i>To add, divide, and measure them</i>

251
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,916
<i>When I, sitting,</i>
<i>Heard the astronomer</i>

252
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,756
<i>Where he lectured with much applause</i>
<i>In the lecture-room</i>

253
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,434
<i>How soon, unaccountable</i>
<i>I became tired and sick</i>

254
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,750
<i>Till rising and gliding out</i>

255
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,911
<i>I wander'd off by myself</i>

256
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,709
<i>In the mystical moist night-air</i>

257
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,553
<i>And from time to time</i>

258
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,158
<i>Look'd up in perfect silence</i>
<i>At the stars</i>

259
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,278
Yes.

260
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,073
I am a nerd.

261
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,549
- Bravo.
- Thank you.

262
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,799
Come on, Pinkman.

263
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,954
You little rat bastard.

264
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,271
Get off your lazy ass
and go break the law.

265
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,113
- Hey, baby.
<i>- Are you ever coming home?</i>

266
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,554
Marie, I'm working.

267
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,392
Did you find it? The RV?

268
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,232
<i>No. Working on it, so...</i>

269
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,316
Why can't you just arrest him,
make him tell you?

270
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,233
<i>It's not simple.</i>
<i>There's a thing called the Constitution.</i>

271
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,437
Constitution, blah, blah, blah.

272
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,669
<i>This kid, I swear to God,</i>
<i>I wish I just could...</i>

273
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,833
This is that Pinkman character?

274
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,069
<i>That's the one.</i>

275
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,390
<i>Positive the little bastard's</i>
<i>got an RV.</i>

276
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,676
I just don't know where he keeps it.

277
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:00,310
Until he actually leads me to it
or does something...

278
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,155
...I'm stuck here, Marie, so sorry.

279
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,915
Well, not to bring up
ancient history...

280
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,790
...but I, for one, can think of someone
who might know something.

281
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,952
Possibly.

282
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,473
It's worth a shot.

283
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,312
Yeah?

284
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,193
Who?

285
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,679
- Hello.
<i>- Oh, hey, buddy.</i>

286
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,989
<i>Hey, how you doing?</i>

287
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,798
Oh, hey, Hank. What's up?

288
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,837
<i>Listen, I hate to bother you.</i>

289
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,798
<i>- I just had a quick question.</i>
- Shoot.

290
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,953
I only ask this because I'm at a,
you know, dead end here, potentially.

291
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,395
I'm working a case and...

292
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,553
You know that I would never put you on
the spot or make you uncomfortable.

293
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,280
Hank, you could just cut
to the chase.

294
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,956
Back when we lost you
and I was trying to track you down...

295
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,111
<i>...through your student,</i>
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

296
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,989
Now, you know that I know
that once upon a time...

297
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,355
...he may have dealt you
a little weed.

298
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,748
- Hank...
<i>- Just a little.</i>

299
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,388
<i>And I so do not care about that.</i>

300
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,710
As far as I'm concerned,
you never inhaled.

301
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,438
<i>Lik e you said, cut to the chase.</i>

302
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,799
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>if this Pinkman kid ever had an RV?</i>

303
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,791
<i>You know, a recreational vehicle...</i>

304
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,272
...you know, like a Winnebago-type
deal, brown and beige?

305
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,029
Why?

306
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,954
<i>Long story, but I'm personally of</i>
<i>the opinion he's moved on from weed...</i>

307
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:39,752
<i>...and graduated to selling</i>
<i>crystal meth, using it as a rolling lab.</i>

308
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,119
Walt?

309
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,509
Yo.

310
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,834
What, Mr. White?

311
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,477
<i>How's my fav ourite genius?</i>

312
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,278
Is this a secure line?

313
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,034
<i>Is this a secure...?</i>
<i>Yes, what's with the...?</i>

314
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,474
Hey, hello to you too.

315
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,074
Listen, we've got a problem,
a DEA problem.

316
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,912
- I'm listening.
<i>- My brother-in-law...</i>

317
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,957
<i>...he knows about the RV.</i>

318
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,109
What RV?

319
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,429
Our RV...

320
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,718
...the one which contains a meth lab,
which is covered with my fingerprints.

321
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,350
What does "knows about" mean?
Does he have it? Has he searched it?

322
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,159
No, he knows it exists
and he's trying to find it.

323
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,233
<i>He has link ed it to Jesse. It's a matter</i>
<i>of time before he tracks it down.</i>

324
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,914
<i>So get rid of it!</i>
<i>What are you doing sitting there?</i>

325
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,516
Better yet, have Pinkman get rid of it.
Right? You don't go near it.

326
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,433
My brother-in-law,
he is surveilling Jesse's house.

327
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,797
So he might have tapped the phones
or bugged his house.

328
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,157
Jesus. Plan A, then.
Go. Get to it before the feds do.

329
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,357
And do what exactly?

330
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,033
I mean, what...?

331
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,239
The thing is the size of a...

332
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,674
It's RV-size.

333
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,308
<i>I mean, where do I go</i>
<i>to mak e an RV disappear?</i>

334
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,879
I'm not David Copperfield.

335
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,634
What do I look like,
the RV disposal people?

336
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,075
- Did you not plan for this contingency?
- No.

337
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,435
Well, next time, plan for it,
would you?

338
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,239
The <i>Starship Enterprise</i>
had a self-destruct button.

339
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,436
Okay. Shut up.

340
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,478
I'm just saying,
you're good with tools and all.

341
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:48,714
Why don't you invent
a water-powered car, you know?

342
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,838
You did that,
you would be rolling in it.

343
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,199
Socket wrench.

344
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,078
The big one.

345
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,995
What? You scared of the Arabs?

346
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,955
You out of your minds?
Why is this in the open?

347
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,190
- Who the hell are you?
- He's Heisenberg.

348
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,590
- Is this drivable?
- Yeah. I was changing the oil.

349
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,877
Finish it. We'll wipe it clean,
take it out to the desert.

350
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,314
Come on, help me.

351
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,596
Hold up. What's this about?

352
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,918
The DEA,
the Drug Enforcement Administration.

353
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,150
You've heard of them, right?
I know you have.

354
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,393
They know all about this RV
and they're trying to find it right now.

355
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,879
I want this off my property now.

356
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,349
No, no, we have got
to destroy the... evidence.

357
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,990
- We've gotta rig this thing to burn.
- Not here. Get it out of here.

358
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,310
Now, listen to me.
I need your help, okay?

359
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,631
If I go down, we all go down.
Do you understand?

360
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,512
All right, just...

361
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,355
I know a way. I know a guy that'll
wipe this off the planet, no questions.

362
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,709
Call him.

363
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,154
Hey, what about Jesse?

364
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,389
What about him?

365
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,478
Hey, it's me.
Wanna hear something weird?

366
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,519
Now, listen to me.
You get that address.

367
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,832
Now, Badger, I don't care how.
You find out where he's taking it.

368
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,232
Oh, yeah.

369
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
Excuse me. Are you leaving?

370
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,472
Excuse me, gentlemen, these booths
are for paying customers only.

371
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,758
Cynthia, it's okay. I'll handle this.

372
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,871
What can I do for you?

373
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,028
You know.

374
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,996
Sunset.

375
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:47,072
Ninety-six, 97, 98, 99, 100.

376
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,231
Beyond recovery, right?

377
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,437
- Beyond recovery means...
- I got it. Beyond recovery.

378
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,909
- Obliterated, no evidence.
- Hey, don't worry.

379
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,992
When we're through with it,
it's gonna be about yay big.

380
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,709
Then we flatbed it over to Long Beach,
ship it across the Pacific.

381
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,031
Chinese turn it into patio furniture...

382
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,472
...so mind at ease.

383
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,996
Listen, can you do me a favour?
I'm obviously gonna need a ride.

384
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,958
- Could you call a cab?
- You got it. Pleasure doing business.

385
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,351
Thank you. I'll be right behind you.
I just need to...

386
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,358
- The hell you think you're doing?
- Me?

387
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,557
This is mine just as much as yours.
You don't get to just...

388
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,676
- Oh, God.
- What?

389
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,671
What?

390
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,759
He's here.

391
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,638
Who's here?

392
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,791
Oh, no.

393
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,269
Oh, God.

394
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,555
Oh, God.

395
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,075
You led him right to us.

396
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,753
Shit.

397
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,194
Shit.

398
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,749
Mr. Pinkman,
you wanna add resisting arrest?

399
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,798
We'll add it. No skin off my ass.

400
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,358
Last chance to do it the... easy way.

401
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,357
Got a warrant?

402
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,790
Who are you, huh? Who are you
and what do you know about this RV?

403
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,997
Well, I'm the owner of this lot...

404
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:46,391
...which means you're trespassing
on private property.

405
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,279
As far as the RV goes,
seems to me it's locked...

406
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,070
...which means you're trying to break
and enter, so again, you got a warrant?

407
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,709
Well, I don't need one
if I've got probable cause, counsellor.

408
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,556
Probable cause usually relates
to vehicles, is my understanding.

409
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,075
You know, traffic stops and whatnot.

410
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,749
See these round rubber things?

411
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,239
Those are wheels.

412
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,833
This is a vehicle.

413
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,473
This is a domicile, a residence...

414
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,397
...protected by the Fourth Amendment
from unlawful search and seizure.

415
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,518
- Why don't you just go out...?
- Did you see this drive?

416
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,954
How do you know it runs?

417
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,873
Did you actually witness
any wrongdoing?

418
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,794
It seems to me
you're just out here fishing.

419
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,477
Don't see that holding up
in a court of law.

420
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,878
Oh, yeah?

421
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,438
Look at these.

422
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:48,517
What do those look like to you?
They sure look like bullet holes to me.

423
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,953
There was a firearm discharged
inside of this domicile.

424
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:56,829
There's a judge or two out there
who'd see that as probable cause.

425
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,433
Call the Albuquerque police...

426
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,674
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

427
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,829
What?

428
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,834
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

429
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,877
Say it. Say it.

430
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,316
- DEA operation, there's 20 guys
rushing in here like the wrath of God.

431
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,995
How could you have known they were
there before you took off the tape?

432
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,388
That's right.

433
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,199
Probable cause
needs to be readily apparent.

434
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,756
There's somebody in there.

435
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,118
"Private domicile
and I won't be harassed."

436
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,796
I'll give you three seconds
to get your ass out here. One, two...

437
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,748
This is my own private domicile
and I will not be harassed.

438
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,797
Bitch.

439
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,149
Fine. You want your warrant?

440
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,671
I'll have my guys bring it and deliver it
on a little satin pillow. How's that?

441
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,109
I waited this long.
I'll wait a little longer.

442
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,274
Hey, Vicky.

443
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,874
Yeah, Schrader.
Get me Merkert, will you?

444
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,112
You know, I say...

445
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,118
I say we just ram him.

446
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,713
All right?

447
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,440
I mean, we... We...

448
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,839
We start her up
and just ram the shit out of his truck.

449
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,468
We make our escape. Right?

450
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,035
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

451
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,154
Yeah, he'd shoot me in the head.

452
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,512
So, what do we do, man, huh?

453
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,194
What do we...? What?

454
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,073
Please tell me you got something.

455
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,395
Yeah, I got something.

456
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,398
It's me.

457
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,031
We need your help.

458
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,629
Yeah.

459
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,394
<i>Is this Mr. Henry R. Schrader?</i>

460
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,875
Yeah. Who's this?

461
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,350
<i>Sir, this is Officer Elaine Tanner</i>
<i>with the Albuquerque police.</i>

462
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,158
<i>Is your wife Marie Schrader?</i>

463
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,154
Yes, why?

464
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:18,392
<i>I'm sorry to inform you your wife's</i>
<i>been in an automobile accident.</i>

465
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,028
<i>She's being airlifted</i>
<i>to Los Ranchos Medical Center...</i>

466
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,509
<i>...and should be arriving there</i>
<i>shortly.</i>

467
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:30,598
- How is she? What's her condition?
<i>- I don't have the current information.</i>

468
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,638
<i>But I think you might wanna get there</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

469
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,470
You're gonna have to
start paying me more.

470
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,273
- Marie?
<i>- I'm just checking in.</i>

471
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,069
<i>I'd love to have some idea</i>
<i>of whether I should cook dinner or not.</i>

472
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,358
- Are you okay?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

473
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,033
<i>Why?</i>

474
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,358
<i>Hank?</i>

475
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,638
<i>What's up?</i>

476
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,998
I told you before.

477
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,193
You will not kill Walter White.

478
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,356
Not until my business
with him has concluded.

479
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,951
We've waited long enough.

480
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,557
We won't wait any longer.

481
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,711
You'll have to.

482
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,509
The decision...

483
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,718
...is not yours to make.

484
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,395
Explain to me, why this man White?

485
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,637
He betrayed your cousin Tuco, yes.

486
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,510
But he's not the one
who murdered him.

487
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:50,598
Was there not another man...

488
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,035
...who pulled the trigger?

489
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,552
A DEA agent.

490
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,629
Bolsa says the DEA is off-limits.

491
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,833
North of the border is my territory.

492
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,633
My say.

493
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,917
As a show of respect...

494
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,113
...I say yes.

495
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,671
The agent's name is...

496
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,639
...Hank Schrader.

497
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,834
May his death satisfy you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

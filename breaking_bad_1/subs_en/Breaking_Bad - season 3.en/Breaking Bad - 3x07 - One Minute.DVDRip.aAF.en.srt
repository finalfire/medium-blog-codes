1
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:33,749
Why?

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,036
Why is this still under discussion?

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,028
I don't like him.

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,589
I don't care who he knows.

5
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,154
We're supposed to trust
him with our products.

6
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,955
Big man.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,713
Big Generalissimo!

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,713
Big fry cook is more like it.

9
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,310
The". Chicken Man."

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,473
You will do what you want.

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,712
But you have my vote.

12
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,439
Never trust a South American.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,992
Dirty, dirty people.

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,877
He broke my toy! He broke my toy!

15
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,032
He was just having fun.

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,075
You'll get over it.

17
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,073
No! I hate him! I wish he was dead!

18
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,237
Marco.

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,789
Grab your old uncle a beer,
would you?

20
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,515
No, no. A cold one.

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,753
This is what you wanted.

22
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,510
Your brother dead. Right?

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,559
You're going to have to
try harder than that...

24
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,197
...if you want to save him.

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,275
How much longer do you think
he has down there?

26
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,475
One minute? Maybe more? Maybe less?

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,718
Family is all.

28
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,111
Hey, you got nothing on me, yo.

29
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,317
All right, you can call my lawyer,
Saul Goodman.

30
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,152
Talk to my lawyer, all right?

31
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,597
You hear me? I got nothing to say.
I told you, you can call my...

32
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,789
Christ!

33
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,349
You got my cell phone number,
my wife's name! How did you do it?

34
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,074
Talk! Who you working with?!

35
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,113
Yes, sir.

36
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,072
If you're ready to talk...

37
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,037
...they wanna get a statement.

38
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,160
Your side of what happened here.

39
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,357
Or we can hold them off
till another time.

40
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,998
Maybe you wanna talk to a lawyer.

41
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,237
There it is.

42
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,793
Yo, Adrian.

43
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,155
Rocky called,
he wants his face back.

44
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,472
Come on, I gotta cheer you up.

45
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,473
You see that?
That's your get-out-of-jail-free card.

46
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,517
You understand
get-out-of-jail-free card?

47
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,638
I mean, just blink once
if you're following.

48
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,475
The DEA's worst nightmare
is that face out in public.

49
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,518
They'll have to steer a wide berth
of young Master Pinkman...

50
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,036
...for fear of the PR poop storm
that will rain down on them...

51
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,875
...if this story ever gets out.
I mean, this beating?

52
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,071
Best thing for you.

53
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,549
You're home free.

54
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,352
Good, right?

55
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,359
Right.

56
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,311
Oh, my God.

57
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,680
You're now the cute one of the group.
Paul, meet Ringo. Ringo, Paul.

58
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,916
This is... I...

59
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,113
Jesse, I'm... I am so sorry for this.
This should not have happened.

60
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,711
But it did.

61
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,310
No thanks to you.

62
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,115
But the plan did work.

63
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:11,432
We would've been locked up right now
if we didn't lure him away. But this...

64
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,110
This... I just...

65
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,839
I never saw this coming.

66
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,391
So...

67
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,959
What...?

68
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,108
What happens now?

69
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,191
What happens now?

70
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,273
I'll tell you what happens now.

71
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,672
Your scumbag brother-in-law
is finished.

72
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,593
Done.

73
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,189
You understand?

74
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,395
I will own him when this is over.

75
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,520
Every cent he... earns...

76
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,036
...every cent his wife... earns...

77
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,475
...is mine.

78
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,797
Anyplace he goes...

79
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,916
...anywhere he turns...

80
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,036
...I'm gonna be there...

81
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,714
...grabbing my share.

82
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,637
He'll be scrubbing toilets in Tijuana
for pennies...

83
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,995
...and I'll be standing over him...

84
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,310
...to get my cut.

85
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,751
He'll see me when he wakes up...

86
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:20,630
...and when he crawls to sleep
in whatever rat hole is left for him...

87
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,190
...after I shred his house down.

88
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,908
I will haunt his crusty ass...

89
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,752
...forever...

90
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,991
...until the day...

91
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,351
...he sticks a gun up his mouth...

92
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,556
...and pulls the trigger...

93
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,757
...just to get me out of his head.

94
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,398
That's what happens next.

95
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,790
My advice:

96
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,113
That's probably
not a good strategy.

97
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,068
They're scared of you right now.
They want nothing to do with you.

98
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,992
But if you hit them...

99
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,799
...they're forced to hit back hard.

100
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,714
I mean, they will turn over every rock
hither, thither and yon...

101
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,475
...until someone spills the beans on you
and anyone associated with you...

102
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,153
...present company included.

103
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,232
Yes, I think what Saul is saying
makes a lot of sense.

104
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,713
Jesse, move on with your life.

105
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,313
Leave it behind, all of it.

106
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,630
Nothing changes...

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,155
...once I walk out of here.

108
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,037
I get myself a new RV
and go start cooking again.

109
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,437
How exactly do you think...

110
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,876
...you're going to get away with that?
They will catch you.

111
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,837
- So what?
- What?

112
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,911
I have a get-out-of-jail-free card.

113
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,790
Hey, I may have overstated
the power of your face.

114
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,349
Not this.

115
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,637
If the cops catch me...

116
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,718
...I give them
what they want the most.

117
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,473
You.

118
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,236
They nab me...

119
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,556
...I make a deal...

120
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,191
...to give up the great Heisenberg...

121
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,433
...and his million-dollar drug ring.

122
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,640
You're my free pass...

123
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,431
...bitch.

124
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,309
<i>You're so sure.</i>

125
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,075
Look, if he didn't give up my name
while Hank was beating him...

126
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,753
...he's never going to talk.

127
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,156
What do you think that was, a bluff?

128
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,676
He wants your brother-in-law.
And there's gonna be lawyers...

129
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,035
...creaming their Underoos
for a case like that.

130
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,590
I'd take it myself if it wouldn't
cause so much collateral damage.

131
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,239
And him cooking again?

132
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,393
Hey, when, not if, he gets caught,
and he's facing 20 years...

133
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,838
...what'll he do then? Believe me,
there's no honour among thieves.

134
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,958
Except for us, of course.

135
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,353
No, he'll...

136
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,476
He'll come around.

137
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,989
And if he doesn't...

138
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,549
...there may come a time
to talk options.

139
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,234
Options?

140
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,957
I'm convinced
Mr. Pinkman was involved...

141
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,317
...in the manufacture and distribution
of phenyl-2 methamphetamine...

142
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,550
...specifically what we call
the blue meth.

143
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,551
I tracked him to a scrap yard...

144
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,109
...where he stored
an early-'80s camper...

145
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,918
...an RV.

146
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,749
While waiting for a warrant
to search this vehicle...

147
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,673
...which I believe to be
a rolling meth lab...

148
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,195
...I received a telephone call...

149
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:07,270
...telling me my wife Marie
had been injured in an accident.

150
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,674
Upon hearing the news...

151
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,913
...I left Mr. Pinkman
and his vehicle to tend to my wife.

152
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,076
Arriving at the hospital, I learned
the... emergency call was a hoax.

153
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,516
My wife, fortunately, was unharmed.

154
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,233
So I immediately went back to
the salvage yard, but the RV was gone.

155
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,595
Most likely destroyed on site.

156
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,877
And it was at this point you drove
to the home of Jesse Pinkman?

157
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,039
I think we're done here.

158
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,668
Agent Schrader needs to get home...

159
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,829
...get some rest.

160
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,630
That's fine. But just to confirm,
you're taking the Fifth here?

161
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,233
Yeah, that's correct.

162
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,152
Okay. Well...

163
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,709
...we just wanna give you all
a heads up.

164
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,436
Mr. Pinkman is pressing charges
in this matter.

165
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,639
He's given a detailed version
of events as he sees them.

166
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,074
The word of a meth head.

167
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,832
We know all about his history.

168
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,356
We're well aware,
but toxicology on Pinkman...

169
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,755
His blood is clean, he's not using.

170
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,912
The kid is even refusing his
doctor-ordered pain meds...

171
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,752
...far as we can tell.

172
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,958
So...

173
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,432
...where do we go from here?

174
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,114
A couple of gentlemen
from OPR will come down...

175
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,077
...probably tomorrow morning.

176
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,310
Janice will give us an exact time.

177
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,270
And you men will be continuing
your investigation, so...

178
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,271
- Thanks for your time.
- Right. We just...

179
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,634
We need one more thing.

180
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,678
A photo of Agent Schrader's hands.
For the record.

181
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,312
Yes, of course.

182
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,676
Bandage off, if you would.

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,110
On the table is fine.

184
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,229
Flat on the table. That's fine.

185
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,279
It's all gonna work out.

186
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,989
You've been too good to them
for too many years.

187
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,314
I hope it goes without saying we're not
talking to anybody about this, okay?

188
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,033
Okay.

189
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,552
Marie...

190
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,392
...who?

191
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,509
Hi.

192
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,877
Do you have a minute?

193
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,999
Sure.

194
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,155
I guess crime does pay.

195
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,510
I don't suppose you just came by
to insult me.

196
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,193
No. We need to talk.

197
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,751
You heard about Hank?

198
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,915
About what happened
with this Jesse Pinkman?

199
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,158
Yes, I know.

200
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,550
Whatever Hank was investigating...

201
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,429
...him trying to find an RV...

202
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,318
...is there any danger...

203
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,755
...that could lead back to you?

204
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,033
No.

205
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,833
Why would it?

206
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,277
Is this why you're here?

207
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,638
I'm here to talk about Hank.

208
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,512
You know what's gonna happen to him
if this Pinkman presses charges?

209
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,149
Hank could lose... everything.

210
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,991
I thought maybe...

211
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,155
...there's a way you could help him.

212
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,158
How?

213
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,119
Contact Pinkman.

214
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,236
Get him to drop the charges.

215
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,473
I don't know what kind of relationship
you picture me having with this person.

216
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,952
- I'm not asking.
- He was... He's... He's not my friend.

217
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,475
- It's not as if we were... even close.
- I'm...

218
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,631
I'm not asking.

219
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,268
But there must be something
you could say.

220
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,355
Isn't it even worth a try?

221
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,430
Hank is your family.

222
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,033
Not currently.

223
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,235
What?

224
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,114
I said, not currently.

225
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,472
I'm late. I have to go.

226
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,669
Hello.

227
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,634
I was starting to get worried.

228
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,912
Car trouble.

229
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,717
Oh, that's a bummer.

230
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,388
You should call me next time.
I'll pick you up.

231
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,991
No sandals today?

232
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,319
I just thought...

233
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,788
A bit more professional.

234
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,278
Well, everything is on track.

235
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,755
We got our distillate.
Just waiting to...

236
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,797
Let's get our trays ready.

237
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,269
- Clean, no moisture.
- Done.

238
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,432
Is our...?

239
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,719
Our solvent filtered?

240
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,872
I thought you might ask that.

241
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,029
Done.

242
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,038
That's good.

243
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,429
That's good.

244
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,717
Hand in glove,
that's what we strive for.

245
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,751
You know, this might be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

246
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,357
So you the gentlemen?

247
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,395
Lucky you boys caught me,
I got a load to pick up in Memphis.

248
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,712
I can hammer it out in about 15,
but there's this girl, Lolly. Maybe Fran.

249
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,110
She's got this fetish,
she likes to get peed on.

250
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,477
I was hoping to see her tonight
but she wants to sleep before 10...

251
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,952
...so I wanna wrap it up here ASAP
because traffic can be a wild card.

252
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,918
Thing is, women who like to get peed on
tend to be from the warmer climates.

253
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,958
You'd think the ones in colder zones
would be more inclined.

254
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,429
Maybe it's a shock
if the body's not acclimated...

255
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,797
...but, you know, I leave that
for smarter minds than me.

256
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,032
Science is a mystery.

257
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,040
Well, take a gander.
Prices are negotiable.

258
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,113
Buying in bulk gets you a discount.
I'm running a special on these honeys.

259
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,432
JHPs. Hollow-point bullets,
known as Black Death. Check it out.

260
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,352
Like that?
So sweet, you wanna lick it.

261
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,750
Nickel-plated brass casing,
Lubalox coat.

262
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,071
Sucker has six razor claws
that expand upon impact:

263
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,629
Shred your mama's head
like a cabbage.

264
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,194
Keep it. On the house.
But I been windjamming enough.

265
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,432
Tell me what you're looking for,
what it is you need.

266
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,835
Vests.

267
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,798
Vests? Hell, yeah, we got vests.

268
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,598
Right here.

269
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,636
Sleek, comfortable, thermally bonded,
non-interwoven Kevlar fibre.

270
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,475
Stop a bullet like a soft wang against
a Quaker girl. Ain't getting through.

271
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,189
And lightweight? So lightweight,
you'll forget you're wearing it.

272
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,079
They work?

273
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,790
Sure as shit, they do.

274
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,951
I don't leave home without it.

275
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,318
What the hell?

276
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,788
You broke my freaking rib,
you maniac son of a bitch.

277
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,478
You're welcome!

278
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,949
Gale.

279
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,790
What temperature did you set here?

280
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,439
Here?

281
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,228
Station five, 75 C.

282
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,990
I said 85.

283
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,275
Eight-five.

284
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,719
I wrote it down. You said 75.

285
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,950
- I wrote it.
- Well, you wrote it wrong.

286
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,678
That's not what I said.

287
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,068
I said 85.

288
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,358
It's always been 85.

289
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,757
Not 75. Not 95.

290
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,069
Eighty-five.

291
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:11,750
This is chemistry. Degrees matter.

292
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,468
I'm sorry.

293
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,519
I'm very sorry.

294
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,749
Great.

295
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,399
You're sorry, meanwhile...

296
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,348
...you've just brewed 50 gallons
of useless sludge. Congratulations.

297
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,796
Just dump it. Dump it all.

298
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,837
This batch is ruined.

299
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,431
You look nice.

300
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,355
I look like a TV weatherman.

301
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,037
You want a coffee?

302
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,233
No.

303
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,676
I squeezed some orange juice.
You want a glass of orange juice?

304
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,073
I'm all right.

305
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,109
What are you gonna tell them?

306
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,432
Here's what you'll tell them.

307
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,353
He attacked you.

308
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,918
- He attacked me?
- He swung at you with something.

309
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,958
- Swung at me?
- He attacked you with a pipe.

310
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,678
A pipe.

311
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,397
It happened fast. He resisted arrest
and muscle memory kicked in...

312
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,755
...and you had to disarm him.

313
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,592
Muscle memory.

314
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,675
Happens all the time. Years of training,
your body acted faster than your brain.

315
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,512
You had no choice but to hit him.

316
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,672
- You had to fight back.
- Marie, Marie, Marie.

317
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,193
No.

318
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,192
I'm not gonna go in there and lie.

319
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,638
It's some lowlife degenerate
versus you...

320
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,074
...doing the job you're supposed to.

321
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,790
Why should you be the one
who pays...

322
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,712
...for doing the right thing?

323
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,474
Oh, baby, it wasn't the right thing.

324
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,675
It's not what the job is.

325
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,914
I'm supposed to be better than that.

326
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,997
And you made one mistake.

327
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,193
No, it wasn't one mistake. I've been...

328
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,397
I've been...

329
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,915
...unravelling, you know?

330
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,954
I don't sleep at night anymore.

331
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,197
I freeze.

332
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,237
I freeze up.

333
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,270
My chest gets all tight.
I can't breathe.

334
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,915
Just...

335
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,592
I panic.

336
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,193
Ever since that Salamanca thing.

337
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,312
I mean, Tuco Salamanca.

338
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,268
If ever a scumbag deserved a bullet
between the... eyes...

339
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,956
It changed me.

340
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,840
And I can't seem to control it.

341
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,311
I tried to fight it.

342
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,352
But then...

343
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,232
...El Paso.

344
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,869
And it's just gotten worse.

345
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,316
What I did to Pinkman...

346
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,230
...that's not who I'm supposed to be.
That's not me.

347
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,037
All this...

348
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,709
...everything that's happened, I...

349
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,276
I swear to God, Marie,
I think the universe...

350
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,070
...is trying to tell me something...

351
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,276
...and I'm finally...

352
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,316
...ready to listen.

353
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,917
I'm just not the man I thought I was.

354
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,509
I think I'm done as a cop.

355
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,079
Now, this is not an easy decision,
but it is one that I have to make.

356
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,878
I'm sorry.

357
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:09,750
This whole Gale situation, he's...

358
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,275
He's just not working out.

359
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,036
Yes, now.

360
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:20,119
It may sound unorthodox...

361
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,877
...but I think our first best option...

362
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,955
...is Jesse Pinkman.

363
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,999
Hello?

364
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,394
No, look. There's a shorthand
that exists between us...

365
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,232
...experience together...

366
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,713
...at a level that, quite frankly,
I'm just never going to reach with Gale.

367
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,720
Look, Mr. Fring...

368
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,514
...when I accepted your offer,
I was told the lab is mine.

369
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,114
And I know best how to run it.

370
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,679
Thank you.

371
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,389
Thank you.

372
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,358
Yes, I will. I will.

373
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,875
Okay. Goodbye.

374
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,397
<i>Listen, something's come up.</i>

375
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,595
I think it's a good opportunity.

376
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,912
There's been a job opening.

377
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,559
I need a new lab assistant.

378
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,837
I already did my time.

379
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,515
Why don't you just go get yourself
a monkey?

380
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,478
I don't want a monkey.

381
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,631
I want you.

382
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,075
Oh, gee, thanks.

383
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,435
Well, not interested.

384
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,277
I got my own thing going on.

385
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,353
And nice try, saving your asshead
brother-in-law.

386
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,948
That's not why I'm here, Jesse.

387
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,712
There's more.

388
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,798
It's more than an assistant.

389
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,839
Partners.

390
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,872
We'll be partners again.

391
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,430
Split everything fifty-fifty,
just like before.

392
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,916
One-point-five million dollars each.

393
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,432
No.

394
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,954
- I don't think you heard...
- I heard you fine.

395
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,111
I said no.

396
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,150
Let me understand this.

397
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,315
You're turning down
one and a half million dollars...

398
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,950
I am not turning down the money.

399
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,351
I am turning down you.

400
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,351
You get it?

401
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,309
I want nothing to do with you.

402
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,068
Ever since I met you...

403
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,432
...everything I've... ever cared about...

404
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,636
...is gone.

405
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,197
Ruined, turned to shit...

406
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,559
...dead, ever since I hooked up
with the great Heisenberg.

407
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,797
I have never been more alone.

408
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,079
I have nothing!

409
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,196
No one!

410
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,075
All right? It's all gone!

411
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,958
Get it?

412
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,109
No.

413
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,794
No, no. Why...?

414
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,030
Why would you get it?

415
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:08,389
What do you even care,
as long as you get what you want?

416
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,788
Right?

417
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,750
You don't give a shit about me.

418
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,074
You said I was no good.

419
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,756
I'm nothing!

420
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,232
Why would you want me, huh?

421
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,633
You said my meth is inferior, right?

422
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:36,188
Right? Hey, you said my cook
was garbage!

423
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,590
Hey, screw you, man!

424
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,035
Screw you.

425
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,599
Your meth is good, Jesse.

426
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,076
As good as mine.

427
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,553
Yeah.

428
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,110
<i>Fifty-fifty.</i>

429
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,998
Yes, fifty-fifty.

430
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,032
Okay.

431
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,597
Partners.

432
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,112
Good.

433
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,473
And this is the statement
you want to give?

434
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,872
Yes, sir.

435
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,633
- Hank, you don't have to do this.
- No, I...

436
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,273
I do.

437
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,953
I'm good.

438
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,716
So we understand
if we write it up like that, you'll sign it.

439
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,517
That's the way it happened.

440
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,351
I accept the consequences.

441
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,960
In the light of these facts...

442
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,355
...as of this moment,
you're suspended without pay.

443
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,156
I have to ask you to hand over
your badge and your gun.

444
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,113
Yes, sir.

445
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,598
Schrader.

446
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,354
Hold up.

447
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,999
Yes, sir?

448
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,511
I just wanted to tell you something.

449
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,116
And you didn't hear it from me.
Don't want you to get your hopes up...

450
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,750
...but the word in the pipeline is
Pinkman isn't pressing charges.

451
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,512
- Why not?
- Who the hell knows?

452
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,874
Maybe you have a guardian angel.

453
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,752
It went fine.

454
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,876
Well, fine means what it means,
yeah.

455
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,999
I'll...

456
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,194
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

457
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,391
Yeah. It's...

458
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,472
Yeah, it's just...

459
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,477
I don't know, baby, I just think...

460
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,632
I think we may be okay. Yeah.

461
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,110
Okay. I love you too.

462
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,472
- Schrader.
- <i>I need you to listen very carefully.</i>

463
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,631
<i>Two men are coming to kill you.</i>

464
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,149
Come again?

465
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,233
<i>They're approaching your car.</i>
<i>You have one minute.</i>

466
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,749
I don't get the gag, jagoff.
Who is this?

467
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,797
<i>They're coming.</i>

468
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,759
Hello?

469
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,109
Hey, li...

470
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,910
Gomey, I don't know what that call was,
but it's dumb even by your standards...

471
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,071
...so call me when you get this.

472
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,794
Finish him.

473
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,508
Jesus.

474
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,678
No.

475
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,118
Too easy.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,274
<i>In the little village where I was born,</i>
<i>life moved at a slower pace...</i>

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,115
<i>...yet felt all the richer for it.</i>

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,037
<i>There, my two uncles were known far</i>
<i>and wide for their delicious cooking.</i>

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,156
<i>They seasoned their zesty chick en...</i>

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,630
<i>...using only the freshest herbs</i>
<i>and spices.</i>

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,951
<i>People called them</i>
<i>Los Pollos Hermanos...</i>

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,678
<i>..."The Chick en Brothers."</i>

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,479
<i>Today, we carry on their tradition...</i>

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,598
<i>...in a manner that would mak e</i>
<i>my uncles proud.</i>

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,389
<i>The finest ingredients are brought</i>
<i>together with loving care...</i>

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,836
<i>...then slow-cook ed to perfection.</i>

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,120
<i>Yes, the old ways are still best</i>
<i>at Los Pollos Hermanos.</i>

13
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,513
<i>But don't tak e my word for it.</i>
<i>One taste and you'll know.</i>

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,390
Two-oh-one-point-six.

15
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,596
Jesus, seriously.

16
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,955
Better over than under.

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,191
Over by a pound and a half.

18
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,794
I thought you were all, like, precise.

19
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,198
Whatever.
We'll just save it out till next week.

20
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,157
We ship it as is.

21
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,233
What, are we running a charity?
Come on, man. We're gonna take it out.

22
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,789
Leave it. One batch, one ship.

23
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,474
Stop complicating things.

24
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,350
Why are you purposely giving him
free meth?

25
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,717
These bitches are bleeding us
enough already.

26
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,269
You are paid extraordinarily well.

27
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,194
- Why can't you just appreciate that?
- Yeah. Hey, I been crunching numbers.

28
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,590
- Oh, you've been crunching numbers?
- Yeah.

29
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,149
And I don't gotta be a mathematician
to figure out...

30
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,276
...that this deal you made is bullshit.

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,829
- We both earn...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,037
A million and a half each.

33
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,033
What's he getting, huh?

34
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,033
Say he's wholesaling at
40 large a pound.

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,758
That's probably high.

36
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,276
High. What, for our stuff?
That's what I was getting.

37
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,829
All right, look,
say he's getting 40 a pound.

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,958
All right, 200 pounds a week
for three months.

39
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,829
And, like, what happens at the... end
of the three months? Look, whatever.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,834
Two hundred pounds a week
for three months. That's 2400 pounds.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,956
Twenty-four hundred
times 40,000 is...

42
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,032
And I swear to God,
I double-checked this like 10 times.

43
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,475
Ninety-six million dollars.

44
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,792
Ninety-six million dollars.

45
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,793
All right? Ninety-six million.

46
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,679
Ninety-six to our three.

47
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,592
That is messed up, yo.

48
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,671
That is so messed up.

49
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,274
- Fairness-wise, I can't even...
- Jesse.

50
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,836
You are now a millionaire
and you're complaining?

51
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,875
What world do you live in?

52
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,716
One where the dudes who are actually
doing all the work ain't getting fisted.

53
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,757
What is going on with you lately?

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,911
What's happened to you?

55
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,555
Hang on, can't we just...?

56
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,594
Hey, we gotta hash this out.

57
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,799
Hey, what's more important
than money?

58
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,989
These things they laughingly
call pillows...

59
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,958
...I would not give them
to prison inmates.

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,997
You want me to go ask for another?

61
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,118
No, just remind me to bring his
from home.

62
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,629
They're not moving his legs enough.

63
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,915
Hey, everybody.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,158
Hi, Marie. Is it okay if I visit?

65
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,319
Yeah.

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,434
His colour looks good.

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,470
Gomey, is that you?

68
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,517
Buddy, yeah, it's me.

69
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,355
That's you, Gomey?

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,273
Yeah, Hank. I'm right here.

71
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,829
Come here. Closer.

72
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,789
- What is it?
- Closer.

73
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,674
Asshole.

74
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,879
Man, he got you good.

75
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,031
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,909
I'm glad to see you still have
your twisted sense of humour.

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,078
God.

78
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,868
Hey, check this out.

79
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,109
I got something
that'll make you feel better.

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,432
Been keeping an eye on that blue meth
of yours. Six, seven weeks, nothing.

81
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,319
Then all of a sudden, boom,
it's popping up everywhere.

82
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,952
Look at the new locations.
Texas, Nevada, up in Farmington.

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,678
Even right here in town.

84
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,071
A teener here and there, you know,
strictly street-level amounts.

85
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,798
Man, it's crazy.

86
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,678
How exactly is that supposed
to make me feel better?

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,713
Because you were right.

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,950
You're the only one that
saw this coming.

89
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,473
Well, three cheers for me.

90
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,194
This thing doesn't do a damn thing.

91
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,635
Hank, it's probably still on lock-out.

92
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,279
It's been an hour, right?

93
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,711
I'm hurting here.
I could use some meds.

94
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,436
I'll go find somebody.

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,239
Hey, no more shop talk.

96
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,958
Sorry.

97
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,150
I didn't see it coming.

98
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,278
What? Damn right, you did.

99
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,556
No, I didn't see shit.

100
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,954
Day late and dollar short, as usual.

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,072
The only reason I'm even breathing...

102
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,830
...is I got a warning call.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,070
A warning call? What do you mean?

104
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,472
One minute
before they attacked me...

105
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,679
...somebody called my cell
and told me to expect it.

106
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,037
A voice scrambler.
Could have been anybody.

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,756
Marie's got my phone somewhere,
if you want to run the incoming.

108
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,750
Not that you're gonna learn anything
worth knowing.

109
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,275
I don't get it. Cartel hit?

110
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,035
- Who would have called to warn you?
- I don't know.

111
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,710
Oh, Jesus.

112
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,958
- Come on already.
- Okay.

113
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,872
Skyler, I had nothing to do...

114
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,910
Are we safe?

115
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,233
Yes.

116
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,151
Are you safe?

117
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,951
Absolutely.

118
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,078
Jesse?

119
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,318
Jesse?

120
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,918
What about you?

121
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,470
Face looks better.

122
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,754
How's it all going?
Anything you wanna tell us about?

123
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,197
What, like my interesting life?

124
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,637
One day pretty much bleeds
into the next.

125
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,989
Been working a lot.

126
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,235
- Got a job.
- Job is good.

127
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,109
It's in a Laundromat.
It's totally corporate.

128
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,429
Corporate Laundromat.

129
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,876
It's, like, rigid. All kinds of red tape.
My boss is a dick.

130
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,474
The owner, super dick.

131
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,150
I'm not worthy to meet him,
but everybody's scared of the dude.

132
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,709
The place is full
of dead-eyed douche bags...

133
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,919
...the hours suck and nobody knows
what's going on, so...

134
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,719
Sounds kind of Kafkaesque.

135
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,552
Yeah.

136
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,028
Totally Kafkaesque.

137
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,678
Majorly.

138
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,635
From the U.S. Attorney in Santa Fe.

139
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,870
Very nice.

140
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,838
You've got all these nice tulips
and baby's breath.

141
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,276
Oh, and this is chrysanthemum.
That looks like chrysanthemum.

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,237
- Yeah.
- Look at these, Hank.

143
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,197
- Aren't they beautiful?
- Beautiful.

144
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,433
Wow, look at the size of this basket.
It's got so many goodies in it.

145
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,036
Look, chocolate-covered pretzels
and cheese sticks...

146
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,668
...and some fancy designer olives.

147
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,310
You had me at cheese sticks. You're
gonna have to fight me for those, Hank.

148
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,914
"Get well and best wishes
from Ted Beneke...

149
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,594
...and all the folks
at Beneke Fabricators."

150
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,752
Wow, he gives you all this time off
and now this.

151
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,673
- Get me a job there.
- I know. He's great.

152
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,957
Boss hall of fame. I don't see anything
here from Kleinman.

153
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,395
They're gonna have to get
on the stick.

154
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,433
- How's everybody doing today?
- Good. We're good.

155
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,360
- How are you?
- I'm very good.

156
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,149
Hi, Hank. Just gonna do
a quick peripheral response, all right?

157
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,118
- See where we're at.
- Moment of truth?

158
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,157
Yeah, I wouldn't call it that.

159
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,437
All right, let's just take a look here.

160
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,998
All right.

161
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,398
All right, now I want you to tell me
if you can feel this.

162
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,317
All right.

163
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,436
How about this?

164
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,872
Okay.

165
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,875
How about now?

166
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,751
Do that one again, would you?

167
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,949
Right there?

168
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,870
- Yeah, yeah, I feel a tingle.
- Okay, on a scale of one to ten...

169
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,476
...ten being your normal level of feeling
and one being no feeling at all.

170
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,073
Oh, I don't know.

171
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,551
- Four?
- Okay, four. Okay.

172
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,032
And how about there?

173
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,033
Yeah. A six.

174
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,638
Okay, good. And here.

175
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,598
Yeah, still there. A little less.

176
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,993
- A three.
- Okay.

177
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,310
All right, good.

178
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,670
Thank you very much, Hank.
Did good.

179
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,276
So this is good news, right?

180
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,793
Oh, yeah, definitely.

181
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,279
Gosh.

182
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,830
It looks like some ne... function
is returning.

183
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,831
Oh, thank God.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,515
All right, so when do we get him
walking again?

185
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,712
Marie, it's important
that we manage our expectations.

186
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,315
We're talking about months
of very hard work.

187
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,438
And even then,
the odds, they're not great.

188
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,556
But you can't know for sure.

189
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,314
- No.
- When does he start physical therapy?

190
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,550
We've sent the paperwork
to your insurance.

191
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,554
It's high-priority. We should have
pre-authorisation in the next few days.

192
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,312
Certainly by early next week.

193
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,833
Next week?

194
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,350
No, that's not gonna do it.

195
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,953
I've looked into this.

196
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,715
And the sooner physical therapy
begins, the better his chances are.

197
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,077
He needs daily sessions.
Isn't that right?

198
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,229
- Well...
- Actually...

199
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,437
...your plan's treatment programme
covers four sessions a week.

200
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,388
Actually, she asked the doctor.

201
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,678
Plan-wise, four treatments a week
is fairly typical.

202
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,798
And the therapists in your network
are mostly fine.

203
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,633
Mostly fine. Okay, well,
there's a ringing endorsement.

204
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:35,192
Look, if Hank had more physical
therapy with better therapists...

205
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,954
...wouldn't it be more likely
he would walk?

206
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,832
It's very hard to say, Marie.

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,118
Is the health plan's way
medically justifiable? Sure.

208
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,475
Is it absolutely optimal?

209
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,473
You know, screw it.

210
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,993
I'll make sure he gets what he needs.
They can reimburse me.

211
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,232
Mrs. Schrader, I get your frustration.
Really, I do.

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,473
But my best advice is stay
in the network. Don't go out of pocket.

213
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,551
Physical therapy is just
the beginning.

214
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,235
We're talking nursing care,
modifications to your home...

215
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,789
...occupational therapy,
medical equipment.

216
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,157
It could run into the hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

217
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,833
So what?

218
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,230
We're just supposed to compromise
on his care?

219
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,551
Well, if you don't follow
the insurance company's procedures...

220
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,233
...they may never pay you back.

221
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,439
I've seen patients and their families
go bankrupt waiting to be reimbursed.

222
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,593
Who is the best physical therapist
that you know?

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,831
I can give you some names.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,070
But they're not likely to be
on your plan.

225
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,468
To hell with the plan.

226
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,550
There he is. Finally.
I went ahead and started without you.

227
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,632
Ladies, this is Jesse-san.
He's in for the full treatment.

228
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,552
Hey, kick off your shoes. Lay back.

229
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,188
- Exfoliate.
- Maybe later.

230
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,430
Where's the maestro,
out parking the minivan?

231
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,953
Do I look like his shadow?

232
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,714
Who cares where he's at?
What am I doing here?

233
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,674
Well, I was gonna have you two
flip a coin.

234
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:21,914
But since the genius can't be bothered,
today's your lucky day.

235
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,435
Look around, kiddo. It's all yours.

236
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,999
What?

237
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,238
- This?
- Yeah.

238
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,551
You are now the owner
of this fine... establishment.

239
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,278
- For free?
- Free?

240
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,718
Oh, ladies, cover your ears.
No, not free.

241
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,917
Look, hey, this is a squeaky-clean,
highly profitable...

242
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,354
At least potentially.

243
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,910
- Iocal institution looked upon with
favour by the Chamber of Commerce...

244
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,073
...Better Business Bureau.
At $312,000, it's a steal.

245
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,515
Three-hundred-and-twelve thousand?

246
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,190
Don't you get it? On the outside,
it's a nail salon, right?

247
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,593
On the inside, it's the best money
laundry a growing boy could ask for.

248
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,909
Wait, wait, wait. Hey.

249
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,799
Ladies, thank you. Thank you.
Good job. Come back here.

250
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,270
Sit. Come on, come on.

251
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,915
Humour me here for a second.

252
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,550
Now, you know you need to launder
your money, right?

253
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,430
Do you understand the basics of it,
placement, layering, integration?

254
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,433
I ain't buying no damn nail salon,
so just forget it.

255
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,192
Don't you want to stay out of jail?

256
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,715
I mean, you wanna keep your money
and your freedom.

257
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,348
Because I got three little letters
for you: IRS.

258
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,954
If they can get Capone,
they can get you.

259
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,193
Hey, look. Here's you, right?
Pink, Pinkman. Get it?

260
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,032
Okay, here's your cash.

261
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,033
You're out on the town.
Yeah, you're partying hearty.

262
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,829
You're knocking boots
with the chicky babes. Oh, who's this?

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,560
It's the tax man.
And he's looking at you.

264
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,073
Now, what does he see?

265
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,800
He sees a young fellow
with a big fancy house...

266
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,520
...unlimited cash supply and no job.

267
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,797
Now, what is the conclusion
the tax man makes?

268
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,999
- I'm a drug dealer.
- Wrong.

269
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,436
Million times worse.
You're a tax cheat.

270
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,830
What do they do?
They take... every penny...

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,072
...and you go in the can
for felony tax evasion.

272
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,754
What was your mistake?

273
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,229
You didn't launder your money.

274
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,870
Now, you give me your money, okay?
That's called placement.

275
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,793
Hand me that little thing... Bin.

276
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,992
This is the nail salon, right?

277
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,871
I take your dirty money and I slip it
into the salon's nice clean cash flow.

278
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,712
That's called layering.

279
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,518
Final step, integration.

280
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,036
The revenues from the salon
go to the owner. That's you.

281
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,112
Your filthy drug money
has been transformed...

282
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,840
...into nice, clean, taxable income...

283
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,913
...brought to you by a savvy investment
in a thriving business.

284
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,233
So you want me to buy this place
so I can pay taxes.

285
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,753
I'm a criminal, yo.

286
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:04,234
Yeah, and if you wanna stay a criminal
and not become, say, a convict...

287
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,914
...maybe you should grow up
and listen to your lawyer.

288
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,072
Right, so you can get your 5 percent.

289
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,196
No, that's 17 percent.

290
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,432
I heard you say 5.
You said it right in front of me.

291
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,797
Yeah, that was for your partner.
It's privileges of seniority and all.

292
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,509
But for you, it's the usual,
17 percent and that's a bargain.

293
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,352
Hey, what? You... Hey, listen...

294
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,318
Come on, I'm talking to you about
your future here. Listen to reason.

295
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,673
How is your brother-in-law?

296
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,632
He'll live.

297
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,916
Good. I'm glad.

298
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,998
Walter, you seem troubled.

299
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,037
How can I help you?

300
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:34,192
I asked to see you in order
to clear the air.

301
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:42,597
There are some issues that could cause
a misunderstanding between us...

302
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,711
...and I think it's in our best interests
to just lay the cards on the table.

303
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,074
That's the best way to do business.

304
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,235
My brother-in-law,
moments before he was attacked...

305
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,834
...someone called to warn him.

306
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,273
I believe that same person
was protecting me.

307
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,199
Those two men, the assassins...

308
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,472
...I believe I was their prime target.

309
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,999
But that somehow, they were steered
away from me to my brother-in-law.

310
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,030
Because of this inte... ntion...

311
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,596
...I am alive.

312
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,596
And yet I think that this person...

313
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,992
...was playing a much deeper game.

314
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,516
He made that phone call
because he wanted a shootout...

315
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,513
...not a silent assassination.

316
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,351
In one stroke,
he bloodied both sides...

317
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,708
...set the American and Mexican
governments against the cartel...

318
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,078
...and cut off the supply
of methamphetamine to the Southwest.

319
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,149
If this man had his own source
of product on this side of the border...

320
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,432
...he would have the market
to himself.

321
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,348
The rewards would be... enormous.

322
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,354
We're both adults.

323
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,550
I can't pretend I don't know
that person is you.

324
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:44,039
I want there to be no confusion.

325
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,239
I know I owe you my life.

326
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,956
And more than that...

327
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,560
...I respect the strategy.

328
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,596
In your position...

329
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,074
...I would have done the same.

330
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,836
One issue which troubles me...

331
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,074
...I don't know what happens
when our three-month contract ends.

332
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,835
What would you like to happen?

333
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,714
You know why I do this.

334
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,472
I want security for my family.

335
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,914
Then you have it.

336
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,596
Three million for three months.
That was our agreement.

337
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,753
Extended annually, 12 million a year.

338
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,156
Call it 15.

339
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,117
Open-ended.

340
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,197
Would that be agreeable?

341
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,359
Part of the reason we talk about what
gets us riled up in our daily lives...

342
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:41,150
...is to help each other put a finger
on what our relapse triggers might be...

343
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,031
...head off our disease before
it comes back.

344
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,032
So, anyone?

345
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,269
Free licence to bitch and moan.
How often do you get that?

346
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,797
Jesse, last time, you seemed down
about your job at the Laundromat.

347
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,839
Let me ask something. If you had the
chance to do anything you wanted...

348
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,513
...what would you do?

349
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,394
Make more green, man. A lot more.

350
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,518
Forget about money.
Assume you have all you want.

351
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,557
I don't know.

352
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,312
I guess I would make something.

353
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,278
Like what?

354
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,628
I don't know if it even matters...

355
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,594
...but work with my hands, I guess.

356
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,232
Building things, like carpentry
or bricklaying or something?

357
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,679
I took this vo-tech class in high school,
woodworking.

358
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,391
I took a lot of vo-tech classes,
because it was just a big jerk-off.

359
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,076
But this one time, I had this teacher
by the name of...

360
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,959
...Mr. Pike.

361
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:03,957
I guess he was like a Marine
or something before he got old.

362
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,189
He was hard of hearing.

363
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,548
My project for his class...

364
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,474
...was to make this wooden box.

365
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,315
You know, like a small...

366
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,919
Just like a...
Like a box, you know, to put stuff in.

367
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,709
So I wanted to get the thing done
as fast as possible.

368
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,832
I figured I could cut classes
for the rest of the semester...

369
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,313
...and he couldn't flunk me as long as I,
you know, made the thing.

370
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,233
So I finished it in a couple days.

371
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,473
And it looked pretty lame,
but it worked...

372
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,712
...you know,
for putting stuff in or whatnot.

373
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,638
So when I showed it to Mr. Pike...

374
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,991
...for my grade...

375
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,711
...he looked at it and said:

376
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,232
"Is that the best you can do?"

377
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,230
At first I thought to myself,
"Hell yeah, bitch.

378
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,918
Now give me a D and shut up
so I can go blaze one with my boys."

379
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,479
I don't know.
Maybe it was the way he said it, but...

380
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,870
It was like he wasn't exactly
saying it sucked.

381
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,194
He was just asking me honestly,
"Is that all you got?"

382
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,709
And for some reason,
I thought to myself:

383
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,830
"Yeah, man, I can do better,"
so I started from scratch.

384
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,878
I made another, then another.

385
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,749
And by the... end of the semester,
by like box number five...

386
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,634
...I had built this thing.

387
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,550
You should have seen it.
It was insane.

388
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,429
I mean, I built it out of Peruvian walnut
with inlaid zebrawood.

389
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,238
It was fitted with pegs, no screws.

390
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,279
I sanded it for days
until it was smooth as glass.

391
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:07,078
Then I rubbed all the wood with tung oil
so it was rich and dark.

392
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,793
It even smelled good.

393
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,078
You know, you put nose in it
and breathed in, it was...

394
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,078
It was perfect.

395
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,391
What happened to the box?

396
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,953
I gave it to my mom.

397
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,718
Nice.

398
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,031
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

399
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,191
It's never too late.

400
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,439
They have art co-ops
that offer classes...

401
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,030
...adult extension programme
at the university.

402
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,909
You know,
I didn't give the box to my mom.

403
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,352
I traded it for an ounce of weed.

404
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,310
He's a hero.
You don't deny coverage to a hero.

405
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,357
They'll say they're not denying
coverage.

406
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,919
No, no, I'm agreeing with you.

407
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,640
But I went through all this with Walt.

408
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,719
You'll burn through your savings,
and then what?

409
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,836
Well, you two managed, right?

410
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,115
You said yourself...

411
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,556
...that Elliot and Gretchen's money
didn't cover everything.

412
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,829
- Jesus, I gotta get back.
- What? No.

413
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,319
No, no, no, you should rest.

414
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,358
Look, why don't you go in
and take a long bath?

415
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,035
- I put some fresh sheets on the bed.
- I wanna be there in case he wakes up.

416
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,112
With all they're giving him,
he'll sleep till morning.

417
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,910
- Hey, Sky.
- Hey.

418
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,670
- What are you doing here?
- Thought I'd stop by...

419
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,229
...to see how you're holding up.
Is this a bad time?

420
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,834
- Hi.
- Hi.

421
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,197
Marie, this is Ted, my boss.

422
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,634
Oh, you're Ted.

423
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,832
I've heard so much about you.

424
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,592
Thank you for your gift basket.

425
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,274
- That was really thoughtful.
- It was nice. Thank you.

426
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,237
- Cheese sticks.
- Cheese sticks.

427
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,834
You're welcome.
We care about Skyler so much...

428
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,673
...that naturally that extends
to the whole family.

429
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,757
Are you coming in?

430
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,308
Oh, yeah, you should.

431
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,472
- I'm sorry. Come on in, Ted.
- Thanks. Okay.

432
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,030
We were having some wine.
Would you like a glass?

433
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,919
No, no, thanks.
I'm just on my way home.

434
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,149
I just thought I'd...

435
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,791
You know, I am really beat.
I think I'm gonna take that bath.

436
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,315
It was nice to meet you, Ted,
and thank you again.

437
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,710
Nice to meet you, too, Marie.
Give my best wishes to your husband.

438
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,518
I will.

439
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,276
Thanks for stopping by...

440
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,672
...but it's actually not the best time
for a visit, so...

441
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,276
Can we just talk for a minute?

442
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,317
I know you need to be
with your family...

443
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,472
...but I haven't heard from you
in days...

444
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,437
...and I left messages...
- I'm so sorry.

445
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,160
You gave me all that time off
and I really should've...

446
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,279
That's not my point.
I care about you. That's all.

447
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,954
Ted, I...
It's just this whole thing with Hank...

448
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,238
...has been one nonstop horror show,
you know, so...

449
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,757
Well, I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

450
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,912
Thank you.

451
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,913
But I really do need you to...

452
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,150
- Okay.
- Okay?

453
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,838
Skyler, I gotta say,
your sister seeing me here...

454
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,835
...I mean, so what? I'm divorced.
You're divorced. So what?

455
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,560
Okay, let's talk about it later, Ted,
okay?

456
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,553
- Is there some reason for secrecy?
- Later. Not now.

457
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,837
- Skyler, just tell me...
- You really wanna do this now?

458
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,355
Are you gonna make me do this
right now?

459
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,189
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,749
Bad idea to come here.

461
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,272
Ted, I'm...

462
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,031
I'll see you in a day or two.

463
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,359
Back at the office.

464
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,790
Take as much time as you want.

465
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,193
I can't believe
you had to crush the RV.

466
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,239
Must've been, like, depressing.

467
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,039
For real. That's a stone loss.

468
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,918
No one misses it more than me.

469
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,674
Free to cook anytime, anywhere.

470
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,479
No quotas, no one to answer to.

471
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,909
What's the point of being an outlaw
when you got responsibilities?

472
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,994
Darth Vader had responsibilities.
He was responsible for the Death Star.

473
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,958
True that. Two of them bitches.

474
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,953
Just saying. Devil's advocate.

475
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,193
I gotta pay taxes? What's up with that?
That's messed up. That's Kafkaesque.

476
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,510
- Church.
- Right.

477
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,993
Let's kick it back into gear.
All right? Let's start slinging again.

478
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,237
- Let's do it. Life's too short, I say.
- Hells yeah, bitches.

479
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,552
We don't need no RV. All we need is
a bicycle, some Drano, soda bottles.

480
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,996
No, no. No shake-and-bake.
Where's your self-respect? Come on.

481
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,310
Ain't top-shelf,
but we could at least move it.

482
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,040
Still kind of dry out there.
It'll sell on the street.

483
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,191
And who says we sell on the street?

484
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,590
Maybe I know a whole new market.

485
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,718
Maybe all we need is the meth.

486
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,834
What's the yield?

487
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,913
Hey.

488
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,916
The yield. Come on.

489
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,274
Two-oh-one-point-eight.

490
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,750
I see a couple new faces.

491
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,673
Anybody wanna introduce
themselves?

492
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,036
Don't all speak at once.

493
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,349
Yeah.

494
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,797
So my name's Brandon.

495
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,078
Okay, Brandon. You wanna tell us
something about yourself?

496
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,357
Well, why I'm here...

497
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,751
...it's just one thing.

498
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,198
It's meth.

499
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,918
It's bad.

500
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,799
Thought I had it kicked a couple times,
you know.

501
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,872
But then, Jesus...

502
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,992
...this new version of it
hit the streets...

503
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,991
...and, wow.
- Not that blue stuff.

504
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,955
Oh, sorry. I didn't raise my hand.

505
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,031
No, go ahead. This is what we do.

506
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,760
Yeah, exactly, the blue stuff.

507
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,074
- You had it too?
- Yeah, bro.

508
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,515
I wish I never even heard of it.

509
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,353
It was like lighting my whole head
on fire.

510
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,080
Yeah. That stuff will burn you down.

511
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,030
Only reason I have a hope in hell
is because it's long gone.

512
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,879
That's the shame of it.

513
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,713
No, no, man. Don't tell me that.

514
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,791
I hear it's back in town.

515
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,110
Stay strong, brother. Stay strong.

516
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,877
It's gonna be okay.

517
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,355
<i>I swear to God, I'll do it.</i>
<i>I will go to the press.</i>

518
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,354
I'll go to <i>48 Hours.</i> I'll go to <i>Nightline.</i>
Don't know if there's <i>Nightline</i> anymore.

519
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,671
Doesn't matter. They will all take it
and they will run with it...

520
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,631
...because he is a hero and he is not
going to be in a wheelchair at 43.

521
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,551
Jesus.

522
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,477
Listen, Marie.

523
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,198
I know Skyler's
already told you this...

524
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:53,319
...but if there's ever anything
that you need, anything at all...

525
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,235
It's good to have you here.

526
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,518
Both of you.

527
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,872
I just wish there was something more
that we could do.

528
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,198
Walt.

529
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,277
We can always pay their bills.

530
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,795
Please,
it's tens of thousands of dollars.

531
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,669
We have the money, more than enough.
Walt earned it.

532
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,832
- Skyler.
- I think Marie should know the truth.

533
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,788
Skyler, I really don't think
this is a good idea.

534
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,633
- I think that...
- He... earned it gambling.

535
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,828
Walt and I...

536
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,230
...we've had our problems lately.
You know that.

537
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:51,713
And what it all came down to really...

538
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,758
...was money.

539
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,151
Pure and simple.

540
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,835
When Walt was diagnosed...

541
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,437
...it changed him.

542
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,752
And looking back, I don't think
I ever really understood...

543
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,354
...what it was
that he was going through.

544
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,988
It was more than facing death.

545
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,277
It was knowing
that he was gonna leave behind...

546
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,912
...nothing.

547
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,148
And so that's how this all started.
For better or worse...

548
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,756
...he wanted to provide.

549
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,871
And so he paid his medical bills
the only way he knew how.

550
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,795
I thought that Elliot and Gretchen
paid for your treatment.

551
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,916
Yeah, I thought so too.

552
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,277
The truth is he never took their money.
Not a dime.

553
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,679
He was too proud to take
what he considered to be charity.

554
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,749
Isn't that right?

555
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,838
So he put his mind to it and...

556
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,839
Well, you know how Walt is.

557
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,911
He's a problem-solver.

558
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,835
And he read books and he did
a whole bunch of research...

559
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:17,630
...and he came up with this system.

560
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,597
A system?

561
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,710
A system for counting cards
in blackjack.

562
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,031
What do you mean, like <i>Rain Man?</i>

563
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,593
Well, I don't pretend to understand,
you know, all the details...

564
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,754
...but he was convinced that if he put
enough money into it, he'd have a...

565
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,717
God, what is it?

566
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,553
A statistical edge?

567
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,749
Yes, statistical...

568
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,592
- So...
- Yeah.

569
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,197
So he... every spare minute, Walt was at
some card table somewhere.

570
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,433
And at first he went to the casinos,
but then he realised that...

571
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,155
But then he realised that the casinos
report your winnings to the IRS.

572
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,788
And if it gets reported,
your family might find out.

573
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,953
If you do not want your family to find
out, you find another place to gamble.

574
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,352
Like an illegal backroom game.

575
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,553
You remember all those long walks
that Walt used to take...

576
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,838
...all that time he used to spend
away from home?

577
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,754
I guess for a couple months there...

578
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,992
...you were sort of
leading a double life, weren't you?

579
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,437
Oh, my God.

580
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,591
Oh, my God, your fugue state.

581
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,712
- Was that some sort of cover?
- No, no.

582
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,950
He did not fake that, Marie.

583
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,588
The night that Walt disappeared...

584
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,351
...he lost $14,000.

585
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,636
It was his pension fund,
our savings...

586
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,954
...basically every last dime
we had to our name, gone.

587
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,154
He couldn't live with it.

588
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,151
He was suicidal.

589
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,996
But you have to understand that
as soon as he got out of the hospital...

590
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:23,678
...he went right back to gambling.
I mean, that's how deep this went.

591
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,670
How could you do that to her, Walt?

592
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,669
Anyway, this system of his?

593
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,834
He finally got it to work.

594
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,153
So all this is to say
we have the money.

595
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,198
No more gambling.

596
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,876
But we have the money.

597
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,917
How much money?

598
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,873
Walt?

599
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:03,158
Well...

600
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,958
...it's into seven figures.

601
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,151
Holy Mary, mother of God.

602
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,792
What can I say?

603
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,876
I did very well.

604
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,672
Marie...

605
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,916
...you will take our money.

606
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:31,111
Use it to take care of Hank.

607
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,589
Please. Marie, let us help.

608
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,710
- Does Walt, Jr. Know about this?
- Absolutely not.

609
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,871
And I need to keep it that way.

610
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,713
And Hank, okay? Hank's got enough
on his mind right now.

611
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,270
- Can we please keep this between us?
- Yeah. Yeah, I...

612
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,273
Yeah, I just... I need to...

613
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,432
Yeah, okay. We'll talk about it later.

614
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,040
How did you come up with that?

615
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,753
I mean, where did you possibly...?

616
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,670
I learned from the best.

617
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,071
Somehow...

618
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,236
...something tells me that Hank
is here because of you.

619
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,869
And I'm not forgetting that.

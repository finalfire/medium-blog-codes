00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,391
<i>We interrupt scheduled programming</i>
<i>to bring you this breaking news.</i>

2
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,630
<i>Good afternoon.</i>
<i>In the last several minutes...</i>

3
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,836
<i>...KOB has received</i>
<i>dozens of reports...</i>

4
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,356
<i>...of what appears to be a crashed</i>
<i>aircraft, possibly two aircraft...</i>

5
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,238
<i>...on Albuquerque's east side.</i>

6
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,958
<i>As of yet details are scarce...</i>

7
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,032
<i>...but callers describe witnessing</i>
<i>an explosion overhead...</i>

8
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,191
<i>...followed by falling debris.</i>
<i>Visible now...</i>

9
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,591
<i>- Crash investigators with the</i>
<i>National Transportation Safety Board...</i>

10
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,479
<i>...are expected on site</i>
<i>as early as this evening.</i>

11
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,428
<i>But officials warn that with a debris field</i>
<i>of this magnitude, the investigation...</i>

12
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,194
<i>Officials are now saying</i>
<i>that the Boeing 737...</i>

13
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,557
<i>...was being re-routed,</i>
<i>or vectored, through the airspace...</i>

14
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,871
<i>...which is standard procedure</i>
<i>according to a spok esman for the FAA.</i>

15
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,237
<i>The eight-seat King Air 350</i>
<i>was a charter flight...</i>

16
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,473
<i>...operating out of St. George, Utah,</i>
<i>bound for Amarillo, Texas.</i>

17
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,598
<i>It sounded lik e hail,</i>
<i>lik e heavy hailstones.</i>

18
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,515
<i>It was just bump-bump-bump,</i>
<i>all over the neighbourhood...</i>

19
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,151
<i>- Indicating that the final death toll</i>
<i>now stands at 167.</i>

20
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,959
<i>- One hundred and sixty-seven.</i>

21
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,350
<i>This mid-air collision</i>
<i>has left many wondering...</i>

22
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,149
<i>...how such an accident could tak e place</i>
<i>in a system with so many safeguards.</i>

23
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,709
<i>- That the collision</i>
<i>which brought down Flight 515...</i>

24
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,190
<i>...was caused</i>
<i>by improper air traffic control.</i>

25
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,113
<i>We have the bombshell confirmation</i>
<i>out of Oklahoma City...</i>

26
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,474
<i>...as the FAA confirmed...</i>

27
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,394
<i>...it was indeed a lone</i>
<i>air traffic controller's fateful mistak e...</i>

28
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,118
<i>...which brought about the crash.</i>

29
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,832
<i>- Is Donald Margolis,</i>
<i>a 19-year veteran...</i>

30
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,959
<i>...of the FAA's Air Route Traffic</i>
<i>Control Center in Albuquerque...</i>

31
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,669
<i>- Margolis recently returned to work</i>
<i>after a five-week absence...</i>

32
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,035
<i>...which was due to, quote,</i>
<i>"a personal loss".</i>

33
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,954
<i>While it's now known that Margolis</i>
<i>had recently lost a daughter to a...</i>

34
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,553
<i>- Drug overdose a month before.</i>

35
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,439
<i>His troubled daughter Jane Margolis,</i>
<i>aged 26...</i>

36
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,512
<i>...apparently had a long history</i>
<i>of substance abuse.</i>

37
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,954
<i>Friends of the family say...</i>

38
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,998
<i>...the death of his only child</i>
<i>hit Margolis particularly hard.</i>

39
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,795
<i>Coming as it did</i>
<i>little more than a month before...</i>

40
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,713
<i>...many are questioning</i>
<i>the timing of his return to work...</i>

41
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,110
<i>...and are wondering</i>
<i>how much blame truly lies...</i>

42
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,430
<i>...with those</i>
<i>who let this grieving father...</i>

43
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,359
I usually open with
"So sorry you're here".

44
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,556
Where would you like to begin?

45
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,678
I really just need this quick and easy,
you know?

46
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,470
As quick as something like this
can be. So...

47
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,873
Okay. Is that mutual?
Does your husband go along with that?

48
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,189
Does he know?

49
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,989
Well, I mean, he certainly knows
we're separated, so...

50
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,559
Has he moved out?

51
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,756
We're in the process
of moving him out.

52
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,069
Yeah. Today, hopefully.

53
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,074
And in the meantime,
my son and my daughter...

54
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,912
...and I are staying with my sister.

55
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,629
- So you've moved out?
- Well, yes, just temporarily.

56
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,995
Only so he could
get his things and...

57
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,948
That was supposed to happen last week,
but then came the crash and...

58
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,917
Oh, God, you weren't one of the...?

59
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,878
Right, yeah.
Right beneath the flight path.

60
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:56,149
And we had debris land in our yard,
and all over our neighbourhood, so...

61
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,039
- Terrible.
- Yeah. Apparently, even...

62
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,033
...you know, parts of bodies.

63
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,671
So I certainly couldn't
bring myself to...

64
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,751
- So awful.
- I know.

65
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,117
Anyway, I was certainly not ready
to move back. But it's time.

66
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,990
And I'm sure we're driving
my sister and her husband up a wall.

67
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,630
Well, you definitely wanna maintain
residency in your actual home.

68
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,349
It just puts you in a better position
in regards to custody.

69
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,714
Two children, you said?

70
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:32,399
Yes. Holly here, and then I have a son
in high school, Walter Jr.

71
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,510
- They need to stay with me.
- Okay.

72
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,638
- How long have you been married?
- Sixteen years.

73
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,394
And it's not an apartment,
it's a house that you live in?

74
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,675
Do you own outright,
do you have a mortgage...?

75
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,595
Yes, there's definitely a mortgage.
We have maybe 15 years on it.

76
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,513
What about other debts or assets?

77
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,671
Do you feel
you have a good understanding...

78
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,070
...of you and your husband's
financial situation?

79
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,155
- Is your husband employed?
- Here's the thing.

80
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,393
I'm really not looking
for any sort of loopholes...

81
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,712
...or I don't know, just...
- No, no loopholes.

82
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,078
I just intend that every one of my clients
get a full and honest accounting...

83
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,199
...of what it is they owe
and what it is they own.

84
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,194
To that end,
I say let's leave no stone unturned.

85
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,188
You'd be amazed what I've seen
partners hide from one another.

86
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,118
Walt?

87
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,029
Hey, buddy?

88
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,273
Hey, Walt?

89
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,555
- Hey.
- There you are.

90
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,518
Listen, I... You know, well...

91
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,872
It's...

92
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,833
It's time.

93
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,880
The shittiest week since 9<i>l</i>11, okay?
Bar none.

94
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,917
This is it.
Hands down, we're living it.

95
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,229
I speak with authority...

96
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,994
...because we had some shitty weeks
the past few months.

97
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,354
But this here? I mean...

98
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,557
...call freaking Guinness Book
of World Records, call freaking...

99
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,950
Am I talking too much?
I am, right? I am, I know.

100
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,954
But this situation between you and...
You know, I don't know.

101
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,509
I'm not asking, by the way.
It's none of my business.

102
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,671
I do not wanna get
in the middle of you two.

103
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,592
I'm just saying, listen, okay?

104
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,035
You beat a little tactical retreat...

105
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,476
...you regroup, and then:

106
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,634
You know, absence makes the...
Yeah.

107
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,558
I'm pulling for you, man.
I'm pulling for you.

108
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,830
- No heavy lifting. I got it.
- No, it's okay.

109
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,797
I got it.

110
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,714
Jesus. What do you got in there,
cinder blocks?

111
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,149
Half a million in cash.

112
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,396
That's the spirit.

113
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,676
I got it, I got it.

114
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,036
<i>Who's here for self-improvement?</i>

115
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,274
Come on, give me a show of hands.

116
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:23,194
Who among you is here hoping they
can actively improve who they are?

117
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,796
All right. See, that's your first mistake.

118
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,316
You should be here
to learn self-acceptance.

119
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,752
Hey, honey,
you want another waffle?

120
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,469
I still got the iron out.
I could cut up some bananas.

121
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,470
<i>Hi, you've reached Walt, Skyler, Flynn</i>
<i>and Holly. Please leave us a message.</i>

122
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,755
<i>Hey. Hello, everybody.</i>
<i>Good morning.</i>

123
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,273
<i>I was just checking in...</i>

124
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,876
<i>...and thought I'd pass along</i>
<i>the current contact information.</i>

125
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,235
<i>You certainly</i>
<i>can always reach me on my cell...</i>

126
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,393
<i>...I've always got that on me,</i>
<i>but in terms of a mailing address...</i>

127
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,551
<i>...I'm here at the Beachcomber...</i>

128
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,076
<i>...and you know what,</i>
<i>it's actually very nice, very pleasant.</i>

129
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,708
<i>Not as high-end as the Oakwood,</i>
<i>but not as corporate...</i>

130
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,192
- Oh, hey, would you please just...?
- Hey, Dad, it's me.

131
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,429
No, I'm not okay.

132
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,192
I don't know what's going on.

133
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,237
Nobody's telling me jackshit
around here.

134
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,391
- Hey, Flynn.
- Whatever.

135
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,278
I don't even care anymore.

136
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,749
Can you just give me
a ride to school?

137
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,948
- I'll take you to school.
- Yeah. No, I'm ready now.

138
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,157
Flynn, I'm taking you to school.

139
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,272
All right, I'm here. See you soon.

140
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,358
Okay.

141
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,791
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

142
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,589
<i>As all of you know, last week</i>
<i>our city suffered a terrible tragedy.</i>

143
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,478
<i>One that none of us will ever forget.</i>

144
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:19,189
<i>Which is why today we're going to</i>
<i>tak e a little time out of our schedule...</i>

145
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,874
<i>...to gather in the gym and talk.</i>

146
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,279
I just find it, you know,
really, really hard to concentrate.

147
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,830
Because of all the horrors, you know,
we perceived.

148
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,717
It just really
gets inside your brain and...

149
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,757
In college, they have this thing
where if your roommate kills himself...

150
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,515
...like, if you come home and find him
hanging in the closet or whatever...

151
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,434
...it's basically an automatic A
for you.

152
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,990
And I just think
that that kind of compassion is...

153
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,720
- Is something to...
- Okay. Thank you, Barry.

154
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,438
Who wants to go next?

155
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,828
No judgments, guys. Just feelings.

156
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,400
You can say anything and everything
that's on your mind. Anyone?

157
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,234
There you go, honey.

158
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,395
I just keep asking myself...

159
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,518
Honey, could you please stand up?

160
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,195
Thank you.

161
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,716
I just keep asking myself,
"Why did this happen?"

162
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,072
I mean, if there's a God and all...

163
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,676
...why does he allow all those
innocent people to die for no reason?

164
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,991
Okay, can we just keep it secular,
honey?

165
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,630
Anyhow, I haven't
really been sleeping much.

166
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,991
Does anyone... else have that?

167
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,790
I just keep hearing that sound.

168
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,678
That boom.

169
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,712
It just plays over and over in my head
like it won't ever stop.

170
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,750
Thank you, sweetheart.

171
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,674
- Is there anyone... else?
- Over here.

172
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:18,113
My neighbour, he heard the crash...

173
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,233
...and he ran outside,
and he found, like, this seat.

174
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,398
Like an airline seat.

175
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,232
Like what you have on a airliner?

176
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,871
Well, anyway, the seat was standing
perfectly upright in his front yard...

177
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,477
...right next to his Sea-Doos,
because, like, he has Sea-Doos.

178
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,912
But there was still a pair of legs
buckled into them.

179
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,272
Human legs.

180
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,792
Jesus H. Christ.

181
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,600
- You okay?
- Yeah, sorry. I'm...

182
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,795
I was just moved.

183
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,791
Maybe we should hear
from the faculty.

184
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,954
Certainly this tragedy
didn't only affect our students.

185
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,960
Mr. White,
would you like to say something?

186
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,952
And by the way, welcome back.

187
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,312
It's so good to have you back.

188
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,152
I guess what I would... Sorry, sorry.

189
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,276
I guess what I would wanna say is...

190
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,069
...to look on the bright side.

191
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,717
First of all,
nobody on the ground was killed.

192
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,279
And that...

193
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,752
I mean, an incident like this,
over a populated urban centre?

194
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,472
That right there, that's just gotta be
some minor miracle. So...

195
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,791
Plus, neither plane was full.

196
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,149
You know, the 737 was, what, maybe
two-thirds full, I believe? Right, yes?

197
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,629
Or maybe... even three-quarters full?

198
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,157
Well, at any rate,
what you're left with casualty-wise...

199
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,233
...is just the 50th-worst air disaster.

200
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,233
Actually, tied for 50th.

201
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,119
There are, in truth...

202
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,396
...53 crashes throughout history...

203
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,678
...that are just as bad or worse.
Tenerife.

204
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,674
Has anybody...?
Anybody hear of Tenerife? No?

205
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,791
In 1977, two fully loaded 747 s...

206
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,394
...crashed into each other on Tenerife.

207
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,437
Does anybody know how big
a 747 is?

208
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,639
I mean, it's way bigger than a 737,
and we're talking about two of them.

209
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,952
Nearly 600 people died on Tenerife.

210
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,513
But do any of you even remember it
at all? Any of you? I doubt it.

211
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,550
You know why?
It's because people move on.

212
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,834
They just move on.

213
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,390
And we will too. We will move on,
and we will get past this.

214
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:34,079
Because that is what human beings do,
we survive, and...

215
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,556
We survive and we overcome. Yeah.

216
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,755
We survive. We survive and...

217
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:47,230
- Okay?
- Thank you.

218
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,553
Good.

219
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,349
Hey, how's your Aunt Marie doing?

220
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,520
Fine. I guess.

221
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,114
You make sure you say hello to her
for me, will you?

222
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,114
Why don't you just come inside?
It's your house.

223
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,957
No, I...

224
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,073
He's gone.

225
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,916
Hey, Flynn. How's tricks?

226
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,038
- How's what?
- Tricks. It's an expression.

227
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,838
How are you?

228
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,072
Why you gotta treat him like this?

229
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,673
Why you gotta be like this?

230
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,197
- Why can't you just talk even?
- Hey, hey, hey. Cool down, okay?

231
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,314
Out of the mouths of babes, huh?

232
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,956
You know, try not to hold it
against him.

233
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,558
You know, I mean, the poor kid,
he's probably just dying of curiosity.

234
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,840
You know, and I guess
it would be natural for him to wonder.

235
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,470
He's probably wondering, "What is it
that could have gone so wrong...

236
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,234
- Marie. Marie.
...that my mother would leave...?"

237
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,118
I can't help you get through this...

238
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,238
...you know, if you won't tell me
what it is that Walt did?

239
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,790
Well, you know what, I don't remember
asking you, all right?

240
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,270
So if you wanna be supportive,
you could be supportive without prying.

241
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,317
- That would be really great...
- "Prying."

242
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,393
...and so helpful.
- Well, prying's a strong word.

243
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,673
It's that voice inside your head.

244
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,473
It's that sneaky, rat-bastard,
24<i>l</i>7 voice.

245
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,119
You know what I'm talking about.

246
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,953
That voice that tells you
you're not good enough.

247
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,994
Not good enough for what?
Not good enough to be what...

248
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,276
...president of the United States?

249
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,630
Well, okay,
so maybe you're not that good.

250
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,429
But now...

251
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,230
...are you good enough to dese...
your share of basic human happiness?

252
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,198
Are you good enough to be okay
with who and what you are?

253
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,510
I say yes.

254
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,590
But it doesn't matter what I say.

255
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,753
It's your voice, which means
you're the one that hears it.

256
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,799
Which means you're the only one
that can fight it, right?

257
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,635
Jesse, we never hear from you.

258
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:38,390
What's going on? You can tell me
I'm full of shit. It's okay, I don't mind.

259
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,870
Just come on. Let us in on it.

260
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,553
So, like, what makes you the... expert?

261
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,312
I don't think I ever said I was that.

262
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,074
Yeah, but you're the one
sitting here, right?

263
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,793
Telling us "thus" and "so,... be happy,"
"forgive yourself," blah, blah, blah.

264
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,194
Have you ever really hurt anybody?

265
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,352
I don't just mean disappointed
your mother or whatever...

266
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,197
...but did you ever really
hurt someone?

267
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,474
I killed my daughter.

268
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:34,479
It was July 18th,
which is my birthday.

269
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,838
July 18th, 1992.

270
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,515
I was high on cocaine
and I was drunk.

271
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,798
Cocaine wasn't an issue. I had bought
myself two grams as a birthday present.

272
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,393
I had plenty left.

273
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,074
But I was out of vodka.

274
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,071
And this is in Portsmouth, Virginia...

275
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,391
...where instead of selling liquor
in the supermarkets...

276
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,278
...they have these ABC stores...

277
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,151
...which close at 5 p.m.,
and right then it was like 4:42.

278
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,076
So I'm arguing with my wife.

279
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,915
"Come on. Go to the ABC for me,
it's my birthday.

280
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,471
Come on.
They're not gonna sell it to me".

281
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,714
And she's saying "No, no."

282
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,510
So I'm pissed. And the clock is ticking,
so I jump in my truck.

283
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,989
She's my 6-year-old daughter.

284
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,152
She's playing
at the... end of the driveway.

285
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,715
So...

286
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,120
How do you not hate yourself?

287
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,196
I did hate myself for a long time.

288
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,119
But it didn't stop me
from drinking and getting high.

289
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,874
It just made it that much worse.

290
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,271
Self-hatred, guilt,
it accomplishes nothing.

291
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,000
It just stands in the way.

292
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,155
Stands in the way of what?

293
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,632
True change.

294
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,512
Skyler.

295
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,797
Is this a good time to talk?

296
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,434
Yeah. Come in. Please.

297
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,717
Skyler.

298
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,275
Do you wanna start?

299
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,072
Okay.

300
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,353
Why are you doing this?
Why are you even thinking this way?

301
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,433
- Is it to punish me?
- I am not punishing you, Walt.

302
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,674
This is punitive, is what this is.
We are happily married.

303
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,599
I am happily married. I am happy.
We're just...

304
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,190
I love you, Skyler.
And I would do anything for you.

305
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,399
Would you even consider...?
I mean, Jesus!

306
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,870
You come in here and you wave
these papers in my face...

307
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,875
...when there's a whole other,
entire side to this thing.

308
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,874
There's your side and there's my side,
and you haven't heard my side yet.

309
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,712
You haven't heard any of it at all.

310
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,950
You're a drug dealer.

311
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,833
No. What...? How...? What?

312
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,672
Yeah.

313
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,830
How else could you possibly
make that kind of money?

314
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,429
Marijuana. That Pinkman kid.

315
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,273
No?

316
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,274
Oh, my God, Walt.

317
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,993
Cocaine?

318
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,592
It's methamphetamine.

319
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,637
But I'm a manufacturer,
I'm not a dealer...

320
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,875
...per se.

321
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,510
It doesn't mean... No, Skyler!

322
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,151
- Listen to me. Skyler, listen...
- No, no!

323
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,596
There are a lot of angles to this, okay?
It's complicated, all right?

324
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,550
So please, let's... Please, let's just
sit back down and talk it through.

325
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,389
I'm gonna make you a deal, Walt.

326
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,156
I won't tell Hank and I won't tell
your children or anybody else.

327
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,117
Nobody will hear it from me.

328
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,909
But only if you grant me this divorce
and stay out of our lives.

329
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,514
- No, Skyler...
- I mean it.

330
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,072
Now let me the hell out of here
before I throw up.

331
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,314
Bye, Jesse.

332
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,355
Your windshield's broken.

333
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,359
Yeah.

334
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,710
Little friction
in the marriage right now.

335
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,713
Strictly temporary. We're just...

336
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,030
We're just taking a little break.

337
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,588
That's you, over there.

338
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,272
Listen, money.

339
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,717
Saul has got it for you,
so as soon as you're feeling better...

340
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,677
I'm better.

341
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,830
You're better? Really?

342
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,116
- What, the rehab? It helped?
- Yeah. I'm done using.

343
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,196
That's excellent. That's...

344
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,951
That's very good, Jesse.
Boy, very good.

345
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,632
You know,
in spite of how bad things got...

346
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:06,237
...it really could be looked at
like a wake-up call for both of us.

347
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,155
I mean, you know, just to get our lives
back together again...

348
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:15,313
...and on the straight and narrow.

349
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,834
You been following
this airplane crash?

350
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,953
Yeah.

351
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,713
You know it was Jane's dad who
accidentally crashed them together...

352
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,878
...because he was so torn up?

353
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,112
Okay, look, let me stop you
right there, all right?

354
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,716
You are not responsible for this.

355
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,917
Not in any way, shape or form,
all right?

356
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,312
Now, I am very up-to-date on this thing,
probably far more than you are...

357
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,234
...and there are many factors
at play there.

358
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,799
Yeah?

359
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,954
For instance, there's some sort of
collision radar on the jet...

360
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,792
...that may not have been working.

361
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,030
That's public record.
You can look that up.

362
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,670
And the whole system
is run on 1960s technology.

363
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,068
No.

364
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,072
No, really, I blame the government.

365
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:15,470
You either run from things
or you face them, Mr. White.

366
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:19,394
- What exactly does that mean?
- I learned it in rehab.

367
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,952
It's all about accepting
who you really are.

368
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,957
I accept who I am.

369
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,348
And who are you?

370
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,036
I'm the bad guy.

371
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,191
Here's some napkins for you.

372
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,279
Enjoy.

373
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,350
- Is the food to your satisfaction?
- Very much.

374
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,950
It's good to see you again.

375
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,991
- May I?
- Please.

376
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,790
I have an offer that I think
will be of interest to you.

377
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,356
I actually am not here to...

378
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,357
I'm here because I owe you
the courtesy and respect...

379
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,954
...to tell you this personally.

380
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,673
I'm done.

381
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,557
It has nothing to do
with you personally.

382
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,715
I find you
extraordinarily professional...

383
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,110
...and I appreciate
the way you do business.

384
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:53,594
I'm just making a change in my life,
is what it is.

385
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,118
And I'm...
I'm at something of a crossroads...

386
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,756
...and it's brought me
to a realization.

387
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,434
I am not a criminal.

388
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,154
No offence to any people who are...

389
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,796
...but this is not me.

390
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,839
I'd like you to hear my offer,
notwithstanding.

391
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,909
It won't change my mind, I'm sorry.

392
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,153
Three million dollars
for three months of your time.

393
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,031
Three months, then out.

394
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,590
Three million?

395
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,797
May I take this as a "yes"?

396
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,630
I have money. I have more money
than I know how to spend.

397
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,195
What I don't have is my family.

398
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,313
The answer is still no.

399
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,031
Enjoy your meal.

400
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,313
Thank you.

401
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,229
That's it!

402
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,194
Did you feel it?

403
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,754
Texas!

404
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,112
I've made this trip three times...

405
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,075
...and every time
there's three big bumps...

406
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,798
...and that's how you know!

407
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,269
We are officially in Texas!

408
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,230
This time I got a job waiting for me.

409
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,353
I got a cousin who's got a body shop.

410
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,913
Yo, that's for me, homes!

411
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:35,829
They call me".Olive Oil" because
I paint them slick.

412
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,478
I do pearlescent, colour-shift,
you name it.

413
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,077
I painted cars for some of...

414
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,515
...the biggest gangsters in Michoacán.

415
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,673
Wow, those are beautiful boots!

416
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,915
Not much good for working, but...

417
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,392
Hey, what's on the toes there?
Little silver...

418
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,394
What the hell's going on in there?

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

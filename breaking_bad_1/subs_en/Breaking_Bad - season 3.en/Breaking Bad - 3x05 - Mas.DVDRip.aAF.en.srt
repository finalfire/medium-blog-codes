1
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,673
I am awake.

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,113
You are not how I remember you
from class. I mean, like, not at all.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,629
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand, all right?
My guy wants 85.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,033
This is all the money I have
in the world.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,431
You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,634
Buy the RV.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,956
We start tomorrow.

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,429
Work it, work it, baby.
Yo, this is sick, brother.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,113
Totally. God.

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,035
Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies
who wanna participate.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,272
- You got the funds?
- Oh, I got the funds. Hey.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,795
Would you ladies like to meet
my fat stack?

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,155
Get in here.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,076
Come on.

15
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,915
Hey, yo, yo.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,038
Yo, you got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,919
I want the... expensive shit.
Don Pérignon.

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,399
It's 400 a bottle.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,916
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll only have two.

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,154
Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses.
I like those skinny glasses.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,711
That's what James Bond drinks.
Mofos, I'm all about that.

22
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,555
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,679
- Where did you get all the cheddar?
- Must be moving mad volume.

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,751
It's funny.
You wanna know what's funny?

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,514
- What's funny?
- This old dude, he gave it to me.

26
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,829
- What?
- He gave it to me.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,513
It's his entire life savings.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,355
- What? Why?
- Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.

29
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,919
Oh, God.

30
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,639
Yes!

31
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,314
All right, living large, players.

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,469
Thank you. Yo, thank you.

33
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,275
- Thank you.
- That was...

34
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,835
Awesome, bro.

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,238
Later.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,479
Oh, man.

37
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,915
Oh, I'm so dead.

38
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,516
I only got... Oh, damn.

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,152
I only got, like, 1400.

40
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,676
Waffle House? Yeah.

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,671
No, man.

42
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,879
Supposed to use that dude's money
to buy an RV.

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,912
- What do you want with a RV for?
- Because, like...

44
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,072
Because, like...

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,638
Never mind.

46
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,994
Jesus.

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,598
Now I gotta, like, leave town
or change my identity or something.

48
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,194
Guy's blackmailing me.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,751
He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.

50
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,831
RV, yeah?

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,876
I can hook you up, bro.
I can totally get you an RV.

52
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,194
- No, I need it today. Now.
- No problem. Let's go.

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,679
You're telling me
you can get me an RV?

54
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,831
For 1400, at 6 in the morning?

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,912
Right on.

56
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,833
So do I need to sign something?

57
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,356
No, it's, like,
a no-paperwork-type deal.

58
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,714
Pleasure doing business with you.

59
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,952
Come on, we gotta bounce.

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,111
- What?
- For real, yo. Get it out of here.

61
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,557
Oh, my God, I love this floor.

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,878
This feels fantastic.

63
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,474
Can you control the temperature?

64
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,155
Yeah. There should be a switch
right next to you there.

65
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,515
It's a thermostat.

66
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,311
Ted, this has gotta be...

67
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,553
...the most amazing invention ever.

68
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,678
I know. Contractor talked me into it.

69
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,799
Seemed kind of extravagant, but...

70
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,430
I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

71
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,269
I can never find anything
in this Buick.

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,069
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

73
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,239
- Why don't you go get your dad?
- Sure.

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,231
Hey, Dad.

75
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,310
- Dad?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,953
Mom's asking.

77
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,076
Wanna come to dinner?

78
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,879
Yeah, I'll be right there.

79
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,750
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

80
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,990
<i>Yeah, right, lik e you don't know.</i>

81
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,435
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

82
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,672
Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

83
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,558
<i>Correct. I did not.</i>

84
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,472
I was sitting at a stoplight...

85
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,552
...minding my own business,
when the man... The man...

86
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,712
The kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

87
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,791
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,678
- Let me talk to him.
<i>- I owe you?</i>

89
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,671
I owe you nothing.

90
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,990
And I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

91
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,071
Trust you? Trust you?
That's a good one.

92
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,719
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

93
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,633
You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

94
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,315
I told you not to cook my formula,
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

95
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,870
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it ain't yours. It's ours.

96
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,075
Plural, bitch.

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,958
You did not have my permission.

98
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
All I know is I got half the money
I'm due...

99
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,273
...and you got the rest.

100
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,998
Escalating. You're... escalating.

101
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,675
You know what? Escalate this.
My meth, my money!

102
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,914
<i>I will be a one-man glass factory.</i>
<i>I will rock that RV 24...</i>

103
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,273
It's buttoned up tight.
Can't see a damn thing.

104
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,112
I ain't feeling it.

105
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,549
No smoke, no smell, no waste.
There's no cook.

106
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,633
Could be they're setting up.
I heard movement inside.

107
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,792
I say we call it a night,
come back with a search warrant.

108
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,554
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

109
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,036
There's gotta be a way.

110
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,910
There's gotta be a way.
There's gotta be a way...

111
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,596
Hey, hey, hey.

112
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,912
What are you doing?

113
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,551
- No, no, no.
- What the hell are you doing up there?

114
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,314
Are you some kind of a pe... rt?

115
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,309
Yeah,
because we were here last year.

116
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,880
Sorry. I appreciate...

117
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,271
Going after the bad guys.

118
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,150
I'm sorry and enjoy the rest
of your vacation. Okay?

119
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,154
Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

120
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,951
Guy's VFW. He's cool.

121
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,793
We're gonna check out a couple more
and call it a morning.

122
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,428
- Okay, what do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

123
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,637
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

124
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,558
Gotta pack.

125
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,634
Where you headed?

126
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,158
Texas.

127
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,549
Hey there.

128
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,353
Hank?

129
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,232
Hank?

130
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,632
Can I come in?

131
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,588
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

132
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,795
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

133
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,871
Catch the bad guys?

134
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,513
Nope.

135
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,793
- Want me to make you some breakfast?
- No. I'm...

136
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,430
I'm heading back out after this.

137
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,672
Now? You worked all night.

138
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,479
Get some sleep, Hank.
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

139
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,235
They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
That's what they do.

140
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,152
You know what I mean.

141
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,991
I spoke with Blanca.

142
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,756
She said
that Steven's going to El Paso?

143
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,839
Yeah.

144
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,196
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

145
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,475
- I turned it down. End of story.
- Good. Good.

146
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,232
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

147
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,551
I needed some time here because
I'm deep into this investigation...

148
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,075
...and couldn't do both...

149
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,435
...so I made a judgement call.

150
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,951
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

151
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,634
You don't have
to go through this alone.

152
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,069
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone...

153
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,832
...before you nuke them?

154
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,399
Jesus, Marie.

155
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,870
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

156
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,031
Doing my job.

157
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,512
- I would like...
- I know. I know.

158
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,238
A condo in Georgetown. I know.

159
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,995
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say...

160
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,153
...I'd like to be included. That's all.

161
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,199
Don't you worry about my career.
My career is just fine.

162
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,069
Did you not wanna go?

163
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,992
I don't blame you. I just...

164
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,311
- Aren't you late for work or something?
- After what happened...

165
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,278
...it would make perfect sense
for you to not wanna go back.

166
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,829
I'm onto some important stuff
right here, right now.

167
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,834
And Mexico doesn't have a damn thing
to do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

168
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,070
I mean, I'm doing
some actual good out here...

169
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,312
...and all I get
are these bullshit accusations!

170
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,358
What, everyone thinks
I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

171
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,192
But I'm onto something. I know it.

172
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,396
You understand me?

173
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,832
You hear me?

174
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,079
What exactly is this?

175
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,189
I'll tell you what I think it is.

176
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,349
A ploy.
A ploy to get me cooking again.

177
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,033
And an obvious one at that.

178
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,077
How do you mean?

179
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,555
As if I would seriously believe
you would hire an addict.

180
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,075
Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.

181
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,232
You vouched for him previously.
I took you at your word.

182
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,996
No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
Let me be perfectly clear.

183
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,994
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

184
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,353
Trusting him with a solo venture...

185
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,717
...well, that's quite another matter.

186
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,151
How he could possibly
produce anything...

187
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,198
...other than a mediocre product
at best.

188
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,716
I am told his product
was more or less consistent...

189
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,474
...with the quality I had come to expect.

190
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,949
More or less?

191
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,437
More or less? Really?

192
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,314
Boy, that is the...
Talk about setting the bar low.

193
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,957
Except you don't do that,
set the bar low.

194
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,235
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

195
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,512
That you believe I have some
proprietary kind of selfishness...

196
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,750
...about my own formula.

197
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,199
Some sort of overweening pride,
I suppose...

198
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,956
...that you think
simply overwhelms me...

199
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,759
...clouds my judgement.

200
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,390
- But it doesn't.
- Absolutely not.

201
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,268
I simply respect the chemistry.

202
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,797
The chemistry must be respected.

203
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,553
I apologise for being so transparent.

204
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,719
Would you take a drive with me?
I'd like to show you something.

205
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,998
Hi. Is everything okay?

206
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,436
She's already finished an entire bottle,
but she still seemed hungry.

207
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,033
Then she fell asleep.

208
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,998
But I was thinking I'd give her another
when she wakes up.

209
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,116
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

210
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,590
- Fatten that baby up.
<i>- Will do.</i>

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,869
Was that it?

212
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,112
So where are you? Are you at work?

213
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,670
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.</i>
<i>I shouldn't be much longer.</i>

214
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,230
<i>- Is that okay?</i>
- You know I love my little pookums.

215
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,675
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years...

216
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,751
...as far as I'm concerned.

217
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,469
Great. Thanks, Marie.

218
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,875
Are you sure you're okay?

219
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,789
<i>Sweetie, what is it? Come on.</i>

220
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,953
- It's Hank.
<i>- Hank? What about him?</i>

221
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,114
I don't know how to talk to him.

222
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,875
I don't know what to say to him
anymore. I don't know how to...

223
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,989
Ever since El Paso, ever since...
Maybe before...

224
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,597
Yeah. God knows
he went through a lot down there.

225
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,958
People blown up right in front of him,
blood everywhere...

226
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,238
...and last week,
El Paso said they want him back.

227
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,389
<i>Yeah?</i>

228
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:40,235
He's not going. Steve Gomez
is going in his place...

229
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,352
...and I don't know
how I feel about that.

230
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,555
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,
isn't he?

231
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,349
<i>Of course, and I want him safe.</i>

232
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,593
But I can't tell what he wants.
He won't talk to me.

233
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,554
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

234
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

235
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,318
<i>It's lik e something's</i>
<i>eating him away from inside.</i>

236
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,234
He's just not the same. He's not.

237
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,713
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

238
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,669
I guess you've noticed
a change in Walt.

239
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,558
Please.

240
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,472
What is this?

241
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,797
Your new lab.

242
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,749
My God.

243
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,955
Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.

244
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,477
Look at the size
of this reaction vessel.

245
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,633
Oh, it's got...
It's gotta be 1200 litres.

246
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,789
Where...? Where...?

247
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,999
How did you know
how to put this all together?

248
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,755
I had excellent help, as will you.

249
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,069
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

250
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,517
I would say so.

251
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,398
The laundry upstairs,
I've owned it for years.

252
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,393
It receives large chemical deliveries
on a weekly basis...

253
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,834
...detergents and such.

254
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,833
There is nothing suspicious
about it...

255
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,755
...and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

256
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,235
The filtration system
is state of the art.

257
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,551
It will vent nothing
but clean, odourless steam...

258
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,438
...just as the laundry does...

259
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,353
...and through the very same stacks.

260
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,950
I need 200 pounds per week
to make this economically viable.

261
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,390
You would choose your own hours,
of course...

262
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,596
...come and go as you please...

263
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,116
...so long as the quota is met.

264
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,638
Sorry.

265
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,555
The answer is still no.

266
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,748
I have made a series
of very bad decisions...

267
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,195
...and I cannot make another one.

268
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,191
Why did you make these decisions?

269
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,676
For the good of my family.

270
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,471
Then they weren't bad decisions.

271
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,555
What does a man do, Walter?

272
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,197
A man provides for his family.

273
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,074
This cost me my family.

274
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,795
When you have children,
you always have family.

275
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,191
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility.

276
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,831
And a man... A man provides.

277
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,396
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated...

278
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,069
...or respected...

279
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,311
...or even loved.

280
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,951
He simply bears up, and he does it...

281
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,470
...because he's a man.

282
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,716
Any chance
we could grab a quick bite?

283
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,390
Thai place around the corner's
pretty good.

284
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,996
I really gotta head home.

285
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,079
All right, rain check, then.

286
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,314
She said it was the tofu.

287
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,390
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.

288
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,549
Great dinner, Mom.

289
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,954
Can I be... excused?

290
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,629
To do homework
or to play video games?

291
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,358
I can multitask.

292
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,594
Yeah.

293
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,431
You wanna take her?

294
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,792
Yeah.

295
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,190
Give me something, Andy. Come on.

296
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,836
Welded onto the back of a house.
Well, that's classy.

297
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,238
Christ.

298
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,993
Okay. Okay, thanks.

299
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,279
Hey, Janice. Janice.

300
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,629
That the last one?

301
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,552
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.

302
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,554
Twenty nine... early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

303
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,509
- Could you check again?
- Now?

304
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:53,429
- Can I do it after the party?
- Janice, I'm...

305
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,999
I'm dead in the water here.

306
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,074
Okay, I'll check.

307
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,071
Hey, how are you guys doing?

308
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,353
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
really good, I tell you.

309
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,033
All good.

310
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,191
- Gomey.
- Yeah.

311
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,352
Time for the little bird to fly the nest,
huh?

312
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:24,949
The right guy for the job since
the bean-speak comes natural and all.

313
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,237
Wanna know how to say
"get bent" in Spanish?

314
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,875
Just don't go native on me, all right?

315
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,952
Hey.

316
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,717
Here.

317
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,796
Know your enemy and all.

318
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,674
- Fight the good fight, brother.
- I will.

319
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,709
Who got a drink around here?

320
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,228
Your hunch was right. One more RV.

321
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,516
DMV said the registration
wasn't renewed...

322
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,593
...but then they realised it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

323
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,035
No police report, either.

324
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,109
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

325
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,908
It's like I'm paralyzed...

326
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,355
...like if I take a step
in any direction...

327
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:57,150
...I'm gonna make
a spectacular mistake.

328
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,910
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

329
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,358
You wanna go to...?

330
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,915
Sorry, never mind.

331
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,512
Anyway...

332
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,029
...breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss...

333
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,794
...and I don't know why.

334
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,199
Yep.

335
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,876
That's a lie. I do know why.

336
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,476
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

337
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,996
He's a really good person...

338
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,118
...but, I mean,
it's not like we're... ever gonna...

339
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,712
Somehow,
and I can't actually believe it...

340
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,715
...but my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

341
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,031
My own sister, my brother-in-law.

342
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,317
My teenage son...

343
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,556
...tells me I'm a bitch.

344
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,197
And you say tell him the truth.

345
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,789
Tell him about his father...

346
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,598
...but I can't.

347
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,799
Ever.

348
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,119
How could I?

349
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,589
And this man that I'm seeing,
you know...

350
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,919
...as wrong as I know it is...

351
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,152
...as much as I know I'm probably
doing it to make Walt leave me...

352
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:29,839
...it is the only thing in my day
where I don't feel...

353
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,275
...like I'm...

354
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,598
...drowning.

355
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:44,068
So he knows about this other man?

356
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,629
Yeah.

357
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,837
So then he'll sign?

358
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,955
Walt says he's not going anywhere...

359
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:58,398
...so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part. Yep.

360
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,678
Genius.

361
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,553
He keeps money in the house.

362
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,149
Your husband, the drug dealer?

363
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,311
How much money?

364
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,629
I didn't count it. It's heavy.

365
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,550
A bag, where he keeps it.

366
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,548
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

367
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,756
No. God, no. I just...

368
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,150
No, I'm just, you know...

369
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,630
I'm just trying to just talk it through.
That's...

370
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,870
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified...

371
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,669
...and twice the price of a therapist.
There is nothing to discuss here.

372
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,674
I'm just saying, you know?
We have a history.

373
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,636
He's the father of my children...

374
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,429
...and maybe what he did, he...

375
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,670
He did it for the family. Right?

376
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,788
Well, guess what.

377
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,474
That is one... enormous load
of horse shit.

378
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,914
Okay.

379
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,833
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

380
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,910
You are a fool to stay in that house
one minute longer.

381
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,310
If your husband won't leave,
then you go.

382
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,630
You are now an accessory
after the fact.

383
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,994
You are culpable.

384
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,038
You, your children,
you could lose... everything you own.

385
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,077
Do you understand?

386
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,036
All courtesy of this criminal
you refuse to divorce.

387
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,878
- I didn't marry a criminal.
- Well, you're married to one now.

388
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,395
How's about we run through this
one more time...

389
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,199
...especially where I do the talking,
you don't say jack?

390
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,238
Oh, I'm gonna say jack.
I'm gonna say plenty.

391
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,517
What did we say about escalating, huh?
Who's got your back here?

392
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,114
Me, all right?
I'm going to take care of things.

393
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,477
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

394
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,517
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

395
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,796
Because I got a drawer full of them.

396
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,032
I get them from my "chiropractor."

397
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,876
Vietnamese, 5-foot tall.
She adjusts you to "completion."

398
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,632
Her name's Kim Nu Suong...

399
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,633
...as delicious as it sounds.

400
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,075
I should give you her card.

401
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,557
Hell with this. I'm out of here.

402
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,392
<i>He's here.</i>

403
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,718
Send him in.

404
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,712
Hello, Walt. Good to see you.

405
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:47,589
Please, have a seat here.

406
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,194
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

407
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,479
You're late.

408
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,552
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

409
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,109
There's always a way
to oil everyone's lock.

410
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,034
This young man is prepared
to offer you a sweetheart of a deal...

411
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,397
...for doing precisely nothing.
- Really?

412
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,111
Ten percent of all future profits
from his solo venture.

413
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,193
That's money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

414
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,830
Consider it a gesture of respect
for your valuable contribution...

415
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,675
...to the business thus far.
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

416
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,798
That's charity, is what that is.

417
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,439
I do all the work.

418
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,319
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

419
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,992
Escalating. Stop.

420
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,631
So there's that,
but then there's one small detail.

421
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:40,951
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate...

422
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,588
...when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

423
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,150
He must not have realised that you two
had come to a parting of the ways.

424
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,993
Take it. It belongs to you.

425
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,230
You're damn right it belongs to me.

426
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,676
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice. That's...

427
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,115
- That almost brings a tear to my eye.
- Enjoy it.

428
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,510
Spend it in good health.

429
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,112
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

430
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,830
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

431
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:14,628
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate...

432
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,713
...was only using you to get to me.

433
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,154
What are you talking about?

434
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,552
See, he needs someone
with expertise...

435
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,355
...someone who knows
what he's doing.

436
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,956
In other words, he needs me.

437
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,596
You're telling me
you're cooking again?

438
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,158
Yeah.
Let's see, how should I put this?

439
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,314
I'm in.

440
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,074
You're out.

441
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,630
Walt, hold on there.

442
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,475
What was the offer, if I may ask?

443
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,630
It's three million
for three months of my time.

444
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,712
You're gonna need that money
laundered. I mean, of course.

445
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,154
What was our deal before?

446
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,356
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

447
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:07,717
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

448
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,869
Five percent.

449
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,598
- Fourteen's fair.
- Five.

450
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,749
- Thirteen.
- Five.

451
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,878
- Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
- Five.

452
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,474
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

453
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,950
Ten even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

454
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,109
Five.

455
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,034
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

456
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,510
That's the way of the world, kid.
Go with the winner.

457
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,875
You think this will stop me
from cooking?

458
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,519
Cook whatever you like.

459
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,468
As long as it's that ridiculous
Chilli P or some other dreck...

460
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,712
...but don't even think
about using my formula.

461
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,917
Just try and stop me, bitch.

462
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,835
- Yes?
- Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

463
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,911
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

464
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,719
I'm with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

465
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,236
We're interested in an RV that's
registered to your name and address.

466
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,038
- Do you have an RV?
- I did.

467
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,952
It was stolen months ago.

468
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,791
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

469
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,677
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

470
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,638
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

471
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,473
I just didn't get around to it.

472
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,473
May I ask why?

473
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,398
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together...

474
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,959
...for an affordable vacation.

475
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,111
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

476
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,838
It was.

477
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,039
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

478
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,675
I didn't want him arrested.

479
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,118
He ran with a bad crowd,
but he was never a bad person.

480
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,597
I thought he could turn
his life around.

481
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,478
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

482
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,678
My son.

483
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,755
I'd really like to speak with him.

484
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,599
He's passed away.
He was shot two months ago.

485
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,431
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

486
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,955
Christian Ortega.

487
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,040
Was his nickname Combo?

488
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,989
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

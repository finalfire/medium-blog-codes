1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,789
More.

2
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,429
Another.

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,874
Careful, señor.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,311
Hot day like today...

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,550
...too much oil in the machine...

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,151
...can cause it to blow a gasket.

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,991
There are two kinds of men
in this world.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,749
Those who drink...

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,751
...and those who pour.

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,797
Shut up and fill my glass.

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,715
Hey, you two.

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,269
Yes, you.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,918
I used to be just like you.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,312
Worked dirt for the man
till my hands bled.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,109
But no more.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,553
Because I learned that a man
can never drink his fill...

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,712
...by waiting in line for the tap.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,389
Listen to him.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,199
He can teach you something!

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,635
Hey, how you doing, boss?

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,558
Good to see you, my friend.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,755
You know, I never pegged you
for such a deep thinker.

23
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,952
I keep thinking I should write a book.

24
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,111
Maybe, maybe...

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,078
So, what brings you to this
burro's asshole of a town?

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,436
I knew I would find you here.

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,190
Don't you have something to deliver?

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,273
Cutting it close, aren't you?

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,876
Lots of time.

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,150
Tortuga may be slow out of the gate,
but he always...

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,554
Finishes first.

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,916
Yes, I know.
Just like your namesake.

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,278
I like the way you talk, Tortuga.

34
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,112
Yeah?

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,669
You've got such a way with words.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,868
They flow like a waterfall.

37
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,674
I like that about you.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,471
I'm so stupid.
I missed your birthday.

39
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,519
No, I feel terrible.

40
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,070
So bad I came all the way here
to this burro's asshole...

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,793
...to give you your present.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,989
Present?

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,958
Come on, boss.
No need to go through the trouble.

44
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,276
Forget it, I wanted to.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,239
I have it for you in the back.

46
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,950
- Back there?
- Yes. Come. Follow me.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,398
It's perfect!

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,239
Do you really like it?

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,037
I love it!

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,316
What a great pet it will make.

51
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,794
Thank you, boss!

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,319
Excellent.

53
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,836
Let me sign it for you.

54
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,469
Let me sign it...

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:29,390
..."For the big talker."

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,990
He's still breathing.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,557
Well, by the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

58
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,356
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

59
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,436
Mum's the word.

60
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,794
Son of a bitch.

61
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,357
Hang on, baby.

62
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,999
<i>Hello.</i>

63
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,032
Walt? Are you in the house?

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,357
Oh, hey, Skyler. Yeah, it's me.

65
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,554
What? What the hell
are you doing in there?

66
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,195
I'm back.

67
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,874
No, no, you're not back, Walt.

68
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,679
You're not back.
Get... Get out of there.

69
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,990
- Well, it's my house too, Skyler.
- No...

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,958
I'm staying. End of story.

71
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,397
- We had an agreement.
- I didn't agree to anything.

72
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,597
Now, look, just come on inside
and we'll talk this through, okay?

73
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,558
No. No. There's nothing to talk about.

74
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,998
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

75
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,435
Well, suit yourself.

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,233
Walt.

77
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,833
Walt?

78
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,909
What is wrong with you?

79
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,312
- Skyler, I have... every right to be here.
- No, you don't.

80
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,631
You don't live here anymore.
We're getting a divorce.

81
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,394
- I don't agree to a divorce.
- Well, it's not up to you.

82
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,510
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police...

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,150
...and I'm going to tell them
everything.

84
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,880
I mean it, Walt.

85
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,797
There's the phone.

86
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,152
It's ringing.

87
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,119
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>

88
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,397
<i>Operator number 314.</i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

89
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,355
<i>Albuquerque Police Department.</i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,998
Yes, I want to report a disturbance,
please.

91
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,833
No, no, it's not...
It's not exactly, it's...

92
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,553
It's a domestic issue.

93
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,593
Okay.

94
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,559
They're connecting me.

95
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,908
Right hand to God, I will tell them.

96
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,514
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

97
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,876
This family is everything to me.

98
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,557
- Without it, I have nothing to lose.
- Fine.

99
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,635
Yes. My name is Skyler White.

100
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,678
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

101
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,278
My soon-to-be... ex-husband
broke into my house...

102
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,910
...and I need an officer to come
and remove him.

103
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,711
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

104
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,710
Okay. Okay.

105
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,392
Thank you.

106
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,512
They're coming.

107
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,599
- Dad's here?
- Great, he's home.

108
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,830
- Dad.
- Hey, son.

109
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,673
How are you?

110
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
Are you back for good?

111
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,351
- Why are you home so soon?
- I'm not.

112
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,319
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

113
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,708
- Sure.
- You want one too?

114
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,917
Walter, your dad and I
have something we need to discuss.

115
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,436
When your sandwich is ready,
I'll bring it to your room.

116
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,555
Mom, can't it wait?
I haven't seen Dad in, like, forever.

117
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,199
- Walter?
- How was school?

118
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,078
- It was good.
- Yeah? Homework?

119
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,357
- No, not really.
- Not really? What does that mean?

120
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,035
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

121
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,350
Yeah, that's the plan.

122
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,270
Hello, ma'am.
We were called about a disturbance?

123
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,479
It's more of a trespassing situation,
really, but...

124
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,993
Yeah, that was me.

125
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,435
You called the cops on Dad?

126
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,110
I came home from work
and he was back.

127
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,510
He had just moved back
into the house.

128
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,676
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen. I just...

129
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,589
I want him out.
I want him out of the house.

130
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,070
Okay, Mrs. White, there's a couple
questions I need to ask you.

131
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,037
It's very important
you answer honestly.

132
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,038
- Did he strike you?
- No.

133
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,193
- Has he... ever hit you?
- No. This is not about violence.

134
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,430
This is about trespassing.

135
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,196
- About him being here against my will.
- Okay. Trespassing.

136
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,830
- You're divorced, then?
- No, working on it.

137
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,512
- Right now, were separated.
- Legally separated?

138
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,035
There's not a court order,
if that's what you mean.

139
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,909
But we've been living apart
for almost two weeks, give or take.

140
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,516
I changed the locks.
Isn't that breaking and entering?

141
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,477
Whose name is on the title
to the house?

142
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,837
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,468
We can't arrest a man for breaking
into his own house.

144
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,029
Not without a court order
requiring he stays away.

145
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,031
Unless he's threatened you
or the kids.

146
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,911
No. Not physically.
But having him in the house is just...

147
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,792
It's not a good thing. Excuse me.

148
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,155
I got her, honey.
Come here. Here we go.

149
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,757
You hungry? You hungry?
Here we go.

150
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,228
That was it.

151
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,754
- I'm sorry, officer. Where were we?
- Disagreements.

152
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,435
Yes, well, we've had our share of that.

153
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,751
I haven't... I haven't been
the most attentive husband lately.

154
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,432
Mrs. White, would this be... easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

155
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,719
No. Nope. I'm fine right here.

156
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,359
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

157
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,114
If you want him out of the house,
you'll have to help me.

158
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,718
Is it possible maybe
he's broken any laws that you know of?

159
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,953
Anything at all. Anything that
we could work with here, just tell me.

160
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,554
Even if it's just a suspicion,
I can work with that.

161
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,870
I'll get him out of the house for you.

162
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,997
What's your take on all this?

163
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,879
It's my mom's fault.

164
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,356
She won't even say what my dad did
and it's because he didn't do anything.

165
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,909
I don't know why
she's being this way.

166
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,154
My dad, he is a great guy.

167
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,915
Son, it's not your mom's fault.

168
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,072
Mrs. White.

169
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,348
I'm sorry, ma'am.
There's no legal basis...

170
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,193
...for us to remove your husband
from the house.

171
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,154
Next time you feel things
are getting out of control...

172
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,710
...you should call this number.
It's the family hotline.

173
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,075
I'd really look into
some counselling.

174
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,159
Best of luck to you folks.

175
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

176
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,073
Why you gotta...?
Why you gotta do this to Dad?

177
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,119
Junior, wait, come on.
Don't blame your mother for this.

178
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,879
Sorry.

179
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,351
Welcome home.

180
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,509
He lives. Happy housewarming, kid.

181
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,955
- Don't look so glad to see me.
- Thanks.

182
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,837
Interesting decor. It's subtle.

183
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,197
The whole minimalist thing never
really blew my hair back, but hey.

184
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,671
So how are you doing?
Staying clean?

185
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,357
Good. I was kind of worried
that you were back to old habits...

186
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,670
...since I didn't hear from you,
you know.

187
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,117
You realise how stupid it is
to ignore your counsel's phone calls?

188
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,872
What if I was trying to warn you...

189
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,350
...that the DEA was gonna kick down
your door? What then?

190
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,478
Why don't you spare me the sermon
and get to why you're here?

191
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,676
Fair enough.
Remember the other day...

192
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,674
...when I brought up the idea of you
getting back in touch with your partner?

193
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,195
Well, I kind of wanted to
re-float that boat.

194
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,828
I'm not suggesting you
yourself get back to cooking.

195
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,752
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

196
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,469
I only want you to convince
the master chef to do his thing.

197
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,552
So, what do you say?

198
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,874
- Sure, man. Whatever.
- Okay. Whatever what?

199
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,395
I mean, you gonna call him?

200
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,553
I said I'll handle it.
Now, bounce, will you? Please?

201
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,517
Final thought.

202
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,275
Look at this place. You're house-poor,
you got no bankroll.

203
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,513
If you get the maestro cooking again,
I'll make it worth your while.

204
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,989
Call him.

205
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,872
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

206
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,075
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

207
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,708
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

208
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,039
Schrader.

209
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,430
Yes, sir. Yeah, what's up?

210
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,959
Yeah?

211
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,949
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

212
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,438
Yeah, yeah, absolutely,
you can bet on that.

213
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,358
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir...

214
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,717
...I really appreciate you stepping
to the plate. Thank you.

215
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,958
So you gonna keep me in suspense
or what? What's the good news?

216
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,238
Merkert called in a couple of favours.
El Paso wants me back.

217
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,437
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

218
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,999
Thank you.

219
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,872
Hello.

220
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,599
Gentlemen. Welcome.

221
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,833
Thank you for coming.

222
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,277
Any difficulty at the border?

223
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,637
The day I can't get across the border
is the day I retire.

224
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,393
Please, come in.

225
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,155
I apologise that it's not
wheelchair accessible.

226
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,595
My apologies, Gustavo.

227
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,916
Of course,
you should have been advised.

228
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,072
It's your territory,
you had a right to bless the order.

229
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,468
But...

230
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,428
We had no reason to believe
the man was of concern to you.

231
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,995
Indeed, he is.

232
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,240
So you're in business with
this Heisenberg.

233
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,995
I don't know him by that name, but yes.

234
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,071
I've made no secret of the fact that...

235
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,392
...I have always done business
with certain local manufacturers.

236
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,077
You and I,
we still make money together.

237
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:20,113
It's never affected our relationship.

238
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,432
Don Salamanca had a
nephew named Tuco.

239
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,949
Yes, I knew of him.

240
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,074
Then perhaps you know Don Salamanca
mentored him in the business.

241
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,234
Thought of Tuco as a son.

242
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,429
When Don Salamanca was no longer
able, Tuco took over for his uncle.

243
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,677
He was a key man in our
organisation north of the border.

244
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,919
He was loyal.

245
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,631
This Heisenberg, Walter White...

246
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,269
...he was one of Tuco's local suppliers.

247
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,477
Until he betrayed Tuco.

248
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,632
So now you see,
blood must be repaid by blood.

249
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,438
Tuco's cousins here...

250
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,238
...they have the right
to exact vengeance.

251
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,909
The Salamanca family, the cartel...

252
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,878
...everyone stands shoulder
to shoulder on this.

253
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,749
Don Salamanca.

254
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,839
Gentlemen.

255
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,230
I feel your loss deeply.

256
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,831
Please accept my condolences.

257
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,036
I have no issue with
your right to vengeance.

258
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,754
But I am presently engaged in
business with this man.

259
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,999
When our business is done...

260
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,831
...he will no longer be
of any concern to me.

261
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,433
Until then...

262
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,469
...I need him alive.

263
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,917
Excuse us.

264
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,234
I don't tell you how to
fry your chickens, Gustavo.

265
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,796
You should really leave matters
of my organisation's politics to me.

266
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,231
Do I not run my own territory?

267
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,753
Of course you do.

268
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,878
And I will advise them to be patient.

269
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,237
But I recommend you finish your
business with the man quickly.

270
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,114
Or you risk losing the
good graces of the cartel.

271
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,318
That would not be wise.

272
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,669
And those boys inside...

273
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,350
...I cannot guarantee
that they will listen.

274
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,839
They are not like you and I.

275
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,632
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

276
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,789
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

277
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,315
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

278
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,472
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

279
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,629
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

280
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,394
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

281
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,519
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you...</i>

282
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:20,716
Sweetheart. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,078
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

284
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,314
Yes, it's okay. It's okay.
Mama's got you.

285
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,830
I've got you. Yes. Yes.

286
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,349
Skyler? Want some help?

287
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,071
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

288
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,198
God...

289
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,388
- What do you mean? Against your will?
- Yes.

290
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,155
Very much against my will.
He just... He showed right back up.

291
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,279
And he doesn't want a divorce.
Won't even consider it.

292
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,230
I called the police on him.

293
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,675
I was so clo...

294
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,037
- So close to what?
- Nothing. Never mind.

295
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,398
Skyler, I can't advise you properly
if you don't give me all the facts.

296
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,793
Understand, I'm bound
by the attorney-client privilege...

297
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,030
...to keep everything you tell me
a secret.

298
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,351
I can't tell a soul
unless you authorise me to.

299
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,029
Even if it's something illegal?

300
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,795
Especially if it's illegal.

301
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,351
I'm your lawyer, not the police.
My job is to protect you.

302
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,948
My husband makes meth.

303
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,916
Methamphetamine.

304
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,672
- Your husband's a drug dealer?
- A manufacturer, technically.

305
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,630
They... They call them cooks.

306
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,037
I looked it up on the Internet.

307
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,910
This is my advice,
and you should take it:

308
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,719
Sue your husband for divorce
immediately.

309
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,316
Let me go to the police
and tell them what you just told me.

310
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,790
I'll go in ex parte to get a
restraining order from the court today.

311
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,430
If he comes anywhere near you and
your children, he'll go straight to jail.

312
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,194
No questions asked.
This is a no-brainer.

313
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,352
It's the best thing for you
and your family.

314
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,312
I can't.

315
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,869
I can't do it.

316
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,593
I don't want my son to find out
that his father is a criminal.

317
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,151
I just...

318
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,639
- I can't do that to him.
- In the... end, it may not be up to you.

319
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,556
Drug dealers have a way
of getting caught.

320
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,509
Walt has lung cancer.

321
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,152
His treatment bought him some time.

322
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,357
But the doctors,
they all say that sooner or later...

323
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,794
I can't see why
I should lay all this on my family...

324
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,037
...when things may...

325
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,873
...resolve themselves on their own...

326
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,268
...without anyone... else knowing.

327
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,394
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

328
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,559
- What are we doing in this shithole?
- Relax, will you?

329
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,950
Relax? This is the kind of place
you get knifed.

330
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,430
- We should have went to Chili's, man.
- All right, already. Jesus.

331
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,832
Outback Steakhouse. It's not too late.
They got that Blooming Onion.

332
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,310
What's wrong with spicing things
up a little?

333
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,359
This spice looks like it's been through
a couple of guys already.

334
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,600
So when you headed back down
to El Paso?

335
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,839
You know. Between all the packing,
errands, getting the ducks in a row...

336
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,310
...maybe a week or two.
- Week or two?

337
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,869
Come on, man.
I'd be dying to get back in the action.

338
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,190
It's not like
there's nothing going on up here.

339
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,634
What are you talking about?

340
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,713
Ain't jack going on up here.
It's quiet as hell.

341
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,237
I'm gonna hit the head.

342
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,832
Those two over there.
I think they're holding.

343
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,831
Man, in this place,
the bartender's probably holding.

344
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,072
- All right.
- What you doing?

345
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,878
Calling A.P.D., what do you think?

346
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,190
Since when can't we handle
a couple dirtballs?

347
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,713
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

348
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,429
What if Vice is running
some kind of undercover op?

349
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,357
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

350
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,718
- Where you going?
- Gotta take a leak.

351
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,314
Jesus, get yourself some Flomax.

352
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,593
Stand up.

353
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,390
You got a problem with us, bitch?

354
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,472
Your move.

355
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,116
DEA. Don't move.

356
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,078
Go out and tell my partner
to get his ass in here.

357
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,552
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

358
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,709
<i>"Do Not Call list."</i>

359
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,155
<i>However, if you're cool,</i>
<i>leave it at the beep.</i>

360
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,272
<i>If you're trying to sell me something,</i>
<i>I've got four words for you:</i>

361
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,032
<i>"Do Not Call..."</i>

362
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,509
<i>The number you have reached,</i>
<i>149-4985...</i>

363
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,309
<i>...in area code 505 is no longer...</i>

364
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,318
Skyler.

365
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,596
Can we talk?

366
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,515
ASAC wants to see you.

367
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,759
And?

368
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,229
We were hanging back,
saw a deal go down.

369
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,072
I went outside to call it in.

370
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,151
You stayed to keep an eye
on the suspects.

371
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,436
That's when they attacked you.

372
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,317
What I didn't tell him is that
you left your gun under the seat...

373
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,040
...before you went back inside.

374
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,115
I've done a terrible thing.
But I did it for a good reason.

375
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,911
I did it for us.

376
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,477
That is college tuition
for Walter Jr...

377
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,679
...and Holly 18 years
down the road.

378
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,717
That is health insurance
for you and the kids.

379
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,391
For Junior's physical therapy,
his SAT tutor.

380
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,110
It's money for groceries...

381
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,038
...for gas...

382
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,991
...for birthdays
and graduation parties.

383
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,868
Skyler, that money is for this roof
over your head...

384
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,429
...the mortgage you aren't
gonna be able to afford...

385
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,239
...on a part-time bookkeeper's salary
when I'm gone.

386
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,109
- Walt, I...
- Please. Please.

387
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,637
This money, I didn't steal it.

388
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,598
It doesn't belong to anyone... else.

389
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,753
I earned it.

390
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,672
The things I've done to earn it...

391
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,913
...the things that I've had to do...

392
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,032
...I've got to live with them.

393
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,393
Skyler...

394
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,476
...all that I've done...

395
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,873
...all the sacrifices that I have
made for this family...

396
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,751
...all of it will be for nothing
if you don't accept what I've... earned.

397
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,632
Please.

398
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,359
I'll be here
when you get home from work.

399
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,755
You can give me your answer then.

400
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,712
Hey, Sky.

401
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,031
- Hey, some coffee?
- Yeah.

402
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,275
That report's looking real good.
I like how it looks.

403
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,919
Good.

404
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,910
Are your kids home?

405
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,956
<i>It's here! It's here!</i>
<i>Everybody, come on in! Look!</i>

406
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,836
Hey, Mrs. White.

407
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,709
Hey, Louis.

408
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,838
Hey, thanks for having me
over for dinner.

409
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,109
Sure.

410
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,593
Hey, Skyler. I'm cooking dinner.

411
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,391
Pot roast. Could you...?

412
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,797
So how was your day?

413
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:50,032
- Good.
- Good.

414
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,189
Excellent.

415
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,589
I hope you don't mind, I invited Louis
to stay for dinner tonight.

416
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,992
You know, as a thank-you for driving
Walter Jr. To school for us.

417
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,960
We've been kind of absent...

418
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,716
...but, I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

419
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,315
Look, I just wanna say that I feel good
about our talk this morning...

420
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,790
...and I'm very eager
to hear what you're thinking about...

421
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,791
...about what we talked about.

422
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,599
But, you know,
whenever you're ready, of course.

423
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,629
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

424
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,430
I fucked Ted.

425
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,075
Boys, dinner.

426
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,639
- Iced tea?
- Yeah.

427
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,119
- Okay.
- Thank you.

428
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:19,633
- Louis?
- Yes, please.

429
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,279
All right.

430
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,999
I want you boys both
to eat your salad, okay?

431
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,119
- Okay.
- I know nobody likes salad...

432
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,959
...but it's good for you.

433
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,031
- Thanks, darling.
- Thank you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,671
Yo, I thought I was gonna see
some, like, vaginas.

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,555
I didn't say
she actually painted vaginas.

3
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,114
I said, some of her paintings
looked like vaginas.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,436
Seriously? Not even close.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,319
Georgia O'Keeffe painted
all kinds of stuff.

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,870
Everyday items, her surroundings.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,273
Some of it evoked an erotic nature.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,149
It's who she was.

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,230
Not like any vagina I ever saw.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,271
This chick have medical issues?

11
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,550
This particular painting...

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,553
...is of a door.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,233
Any other doors we can check out?

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,119
Like, real ones or...?

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,469
You know, I don't get it.

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,473
Why would anyone
paint a picture of a door...

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,837
...over and over again,
like, dozens of times?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,436
- But it wasn't the same.
- Yeah, it was.

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,194
It was the same subject,
but different every time.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,828
The light was different,
her mood was different.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,468
She saw something new
every time she painted it.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,518
And that's not psycho to you?

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,672
Well, then why should we do anything
more than once?

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,269
Should I just smoke
this one cigarette?

25
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,876
Maybe we should only have sex once,
if it's the same thing.

26
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,635
- Whoa, no.
- Should we just watch one sunset?

27
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,788
Or live just one day?

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,437
It's new every time.
Each time is a different experience.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,909
Okay, fine.

30
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,552
I guess the cow skull pictures
were cool, but a door?

31
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,389
I will say it again. A door.

32
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,750
Why not a door? Sometimes
you get fixated on something...

33
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,115
...and you might not even get why.

34
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,714
You open yourself up
and go with the flow...

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,394
...wherever the universe takes you.

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,076
Okay, so the universe
took her to a door.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,950
And she got all obsessed with it
and just had to paint it 20 times...

38
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,792
...until it was perfect.

39
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,110
I wouldn't say that. Nothing's perfect.

40
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,397
Yeah? Well...

41
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,832
...I mean...

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,355
...some things.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,557
That was so sweet,
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit.

44
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,434
You can't admit, just for once,
that I'm right.

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,798
Come on. That O'Keeffe lady
kept trying over and over...

46
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,077
...until that stupid door was perfect.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,119
No. That door was her home
and she loved it.

48
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,076
To me,
that's about making that feeling last.

49
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,878
All right, here we go. You ready?

50
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,788
Come on, give me a step.
Give me one step.

51
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,954
Nope. Nope, that's it. Take me up.

52
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,519
You can do this, Hank.

53
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:12,958
Come on, it's supposed to hurt.
Pain is weakness leaving your body.

54
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,031
Pain is my foot in your ass, Marie.

55
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,192
- Lf you can get your leg up, go for it.
- Take me up.

56
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,591
Coffee break. We're gonna let you rest
and then try again.

57
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,469
Never mind about your coffee break.
Take me up. I'm done. I'm done.

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,798
- We'll just pick up where we left off.
- Come on, Hank.

59
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,952
You can do it. How else
are you gonna get out of here?

60
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,476
Don't you have any friends?
I mean, Jesus, find something to do.

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,519
I don't need everyone staring at me
hanging here like a camel's ball sack.

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,148
Hank, he just wants to be supportive.

63
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,197
It's all right.

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,751
I'll be right back, okay?
Be right back.

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,672
Gonna get me out of here
sometime today?

66
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,359
Sky?

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,639
We got our first bill,
and, you know, if you're still insistent...

68
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,518
I am.

69
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,670
Prepare yourself.

70
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,956
They're gonna start coming in weekly
like that, so...

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,998
You're sure you can do this?

72
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,798
Yeah.

73
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,472
I'll do that.

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,597
What the hell, man?

75
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,709
What, I can't work a scale now?

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,751
This is bullshit. Just say it.

77
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,273
Just say the words.

78
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,635
You think I'm stealing.

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,310
Walk with who you are.

80
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,392
That was the phrase my sponsor
used to use with me...

81
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,120
...back when I first started
coming to meetings.

82
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,034
It's probably just a different way
of saying be yourself, right?

83
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,631
But this idea of "walk" also tells me...

84
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,755
...that I have to move forward.
Always good advice, at least for me.

85
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,473
I see we have some new people here
at Group, a couple new faces.

86
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,349
See some hands? First time?

87
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,396
Great. Welcome.

88
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,949
Maybe we can go around,
introduce ourselves.

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,156
Say whatever's on your mind.

90
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,959
How about you?
You wanna start us off?

91
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,073
Yeah. My name is Andrea...

92
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,233
We don't bite. No judgements.

93
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,517
You can be as open and honest
as you wanna be.

94
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,632
Honestly? I don't wanna be here.

95
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,237
All right, fair enough.
Who else had their hand up?

96
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,438
Hey, what's up?

97
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,671
My name's Jesse.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,788
Well, hello. My name's Brandon.

99
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,915
And this is, I believe, Peter?

100
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,833
Right, I'm Peter. How are you?

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,798
Look, I just wanted
to give you a heads up.

102
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,315
It's gonna get slower
smuggling product...

103
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,948
...with Grandpa Anus
watching every move I make.

104
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,950
But don't worry, I'll keep it flowing.

105
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,395
- Great, right on.
- Yeah.

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,632
So how's it selling?

107
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,233
Mad volume?

108
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,910
Yeah, it's...

109
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,431
You know, it's...

110
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,914
It's not so good.

111
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,514
What do you mean?
How much have you sold?

112
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,873
I sold a teenth.

113
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,158
- One teenth? That's it?
- Yeah.

114
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,389
To who?

115
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,712
To him.

116
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,393
It's not easy selling to these people.
They're trying to better themselves.

117
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,916
Yeah, there's, like, positivity and stuff
going on here.

118
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,398
I'm out risking my ass
to get product for you two,

119
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,233
and you're too pussy to sell?

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,076
You're pathetic.

121
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,519
You know what? I want it back.
All of it.

122
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,911
- I'll sell it myself.
- Come on, man. Don't be like that.

123
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,550
Selling to these people,
it's like shooting a baby in the face.

124
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,870
It's not so easy like you think.

125
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,795
I will show you
exactly how easy it is.

126
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,038
- Thank you.
- All right.

127
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,031
See you next week.

128
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,109
- Oh, hey, sorry.
- No, go ahead.

129
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,637
Andrea, right?

130
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,192
- Yeah.
- Hey, my name's Jesse...

131
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,118
...and I don't really
wanna be here... either.

132
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,749
Sorry.

133
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,639
Aunt Marie's coming to dinner?

134
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,472
No.

135
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,916
Your dad is.

136
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,119
How'd you get her to sleep so quick?

137
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,271
Are you that boring?

138
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,995
I'm comforting.

139
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,597
I'm a comforting presence.

140
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,115
Hey, so check it out.

141
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,391
See what that means?

142
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,549
Check out the date.

143
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,036
Next Thursday is officially six months
that I've had my learner's.

144
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,037
Which means I can get my provisional
and start driving by myself.

145
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,555
You don't turn 16
for two more months.

146
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,075
It doesn't matter, it's a provisional.

147
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,073
Look it up. They changed the law
like, 10 years ago.

148
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,071
Yeah, well, I didn't vote for that.

149
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,357
Doesn't matter if you voted for it,
it's the law.

150
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,555
So both of you start thinking about
what kind of car you wanna buy me.

151
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,236
I think I'd be good
with either an old IROC or a 'Stang.

152
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,634
A 'Stang.

153
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,953
How about something
with playing cards in the spokes?

154
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,112
Makes a nice motory sound,
you know?

155
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,113
Dad, you're not gonna
get off that easy.

156
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,116
Well, I think that this is...

157
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,636
We should probably
table this discussion for later.

158
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,270
Your dad and I have a couple things
we need to talk about, so...

159
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,112
Okay.

160
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,471
A 1971 Mach 1 fastback...

161
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,031
...in Grabber Lime
with a shaker hood.

162
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,519
'Stang.

163
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,834
I'll write that down so we don't forget.
Oh, darn it, no pencil.

164
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,875
What is
"Ice Station Zebra Associates"?

165
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,630
It's a loan out, it's fine.

166
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,711
Whose loan out?

167
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,474
It's fine. Really.

168
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,038
I...

169
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,715
...have a guy.

170
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Okay.

171
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,509
Does your guy know the tax code
and regulations in New Mexico?

172
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,639
There's very specific paperwork that
has to be submitted quarterly on this.

173
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,473
Yes. My guy is a top...

174
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,273
...guy.
- Who is he?

175
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,909
What's his name?
What are his qualifications?

176
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,279
Walt, this money
has to be unimpeachable...

177
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,829
...when it reaches Hank and Marie.

178
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,310
And it is. It will be.

179
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,519
But how do I know that? I mean,
you can't even tell me the man's name.

180
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,831
Jesus, Skyler,
do you really wanna know?

181
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,519
Do you really wanna know?

182
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,032
Really?

183
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,917
What a pleasure it is to have you.

184
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,311
I'm gonna call you Skyler,
if that's okay. It's a lovely name.

185
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,711
Reminds me of a big beautiful sky.

186
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:45,351
Walt never told me how lucky he was...
Prior to recent unfortunate... events.

187
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,478
His taste in women
is the same as his taste in lawyers...

188
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,110
...only the very best
with just the right amount of dirty.

189
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,836
That's a joke. That's a joke.

190
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,514
It funny because you are so clearly
very classy.

191
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,148
Here, please, sit down.

192
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,440
So Walt tells me that you have
some concerns I can alleviate.

193
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,795
Yes, I do. I have...

194
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,636
...concerns.

195
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,191
If we're going to go down this road...

196
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,318
...and clearly we are
for the sake of my brother-in-law...

197
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,430
I've heard about him.
He's an American hero.

198
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,548
At any rate, I need some assurances
that we're gonna go about this...

199
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,076
...in a manner that is extremely safe
and cautious.

200
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,073
Fair enough.
I'll walk you through the process.

201
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,392
First step is something we like to call
money laundering, all right?

202
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,348
Take your money, represented by,
say, these jelly beans...

203
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,954
You know, I'm a bookkeeper,
so I actually...

204
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,236
I know what money laundering is.

205
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,788
- Well.
- Yeah.

206
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,669
And as with most things,
the devil is in the details.

207
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,072
So to begin with, what are we saying
is the source of this money?

208
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,753
That's simple.

209
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,993
Walt here, actually came up with
a great story about gambling winnings.

210
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,469
Blackjack, right?
Some card-counting system?

211
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,949
Well, actually that was Skyler's idea.

212
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,916
Well, you grow more gorgeous
by the minute.

213
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,509
There you have it.

214
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,719
I'll generate false Currency Transaction
Reports out the wazoo...

215
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,237
...as well as the necessary W-2Gs.
I know a couple casino managers...

216
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,278
...who will jump at the chance
to report false losses.

217
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,919
It's a win-win for everyone.

218
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,634
Yeah, but you can't sell that
for very long...

219
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,268
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Way ahead of you.

220
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
We declare just enough
not to arouse suspicion...

221
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:43,836
...then Walt's onetime winnings
become seed money for an investment.

222
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,797
Investment in what?

223
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,712
Drum roll, please. Wait for it.

224
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,916
Laser tag.

225
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,757
Laser tag. Seven thousand square feet
of rollicking fun...

226
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,309
...in the heart
of northern Bernalillo County.

227
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,235
Laser tag?

228
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,395
Yeah, there's guns and glow lights,
and kids wear the vests...

229
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,313
Yeah, no, no. I actually...
I know what it is.

230
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,438
It's just that in relation to Walt, it's...

231
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,512
I mean, it doesn't make any sense.

232
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,117
Makes more sense
than you two being together.

233
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,353
Do you even know Walt?
I mean, how would he, of all people...

234
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,115
...buy a laser tag business?
It doesn't add up.

235
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,353
It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist,
scientists love lasers.

236
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,671
Plus, they got bumper boats, so...

237
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,159
"Hey, everybody...

238
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,075
...Walt suddenly decided to invest
in laser tag. Just out of the blue".

239
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,631
Really? That's what we're supposed
to tell people, our family, our friends...

240
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,153
...the government?

241
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,995
Let me bottom line this for you.
You don't need to be involved, okay?

242
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,435
I've been doing this
for a lot of years...

243
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,398
...successfully, believe it or not,
without your help.

244
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,519
So thank you for stopping by.

245
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,560
You want a beer or something?

246
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,191
Or something?

247
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,078
What do you mean?

248
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,189
Like, beer.

249
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,828
I'm cleaned out of anything else.

250
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,595
Even if I wasn't,
we're not supposed to.

251
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,671
Yeah.

252
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,309
I've heard it over and over
and over again.

253
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,629
You know,
don't you think it's ridiculous...

254
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,349
...that society says beer is okay...

255
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,036
...and a little hit of something sweet
is wrong?

256
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,274
I mean, what's the point
of shutting yourself off completely...

257
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,989
...from something
that lifts you off the ground?

258
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:13,557
I spend so much energy
fighting the urge not to use...

259
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,030
...and I feel like crap because of it.

260
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,073
- I know, it's just...
- What?

261
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,269
I can't get caught using again.

262
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,110
See, the thing is...

263
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,598
...not to get caught.

264
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,911
You ever try that blue stuff
that's going around?

265
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,954
Just a little gas in the tank...

266
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,989
...and suddenly
everything is interesting.

267
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,236
Man, I wish
I could make that feeling last.

268
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,590
Like I said, I got nothing here.

269
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,309
What if I could get some?

270
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,114
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Hey, baby.

271
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,195
Your nana brought you home... early.

272
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,914
Grandma, I thought
you were keeping Brock today?

273
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,992
I was, then I saw your car.

274
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,035
- I thought you had a meeting.
- I did, but we changed the time.

275
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,239
Grandma, this is Jesse.
He's from the meeting.

276
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,313
He's like a sponsor.
Jesse, this is Grandma.

277
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,352
Jesse, this is Brock.

278
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,319
So you have a kid, huh?

279
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,913
What's up?

280
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,277
Brock, huh?

281
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,870
That's a cool name.

282
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,513
Here, give it up.

283
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:32,433
Brock is almost 6.
You okay, with kids?

284
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,433
What? Yeah. Yeah, he's cool.

285
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,515
Okay, Brock is gonna go play
in his room while the big people talk.

286
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,592
He's gonna go play with his Legos
and his cars.

287
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,591
- Say, "Bye, Jesse".
- Bye, Jesse.

288
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,116
Hope you had a good time
at Grandma's.

289
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,510
Oh, I fixed your blue car,
do you remember?

290
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,795
The convertible one?

291
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,509
You can jump on your bed.
Play with your toys.

292
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,435
Safe and cautious, that's all I'm asking,
and that man...

293
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,075
...is neither.

294
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,233
I'll admit
he comes across like a circus clown...

295
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,232
...but he knows what he's doing.

296
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,756
And safe and cautious
is you not being involved in this at all.

297
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,876
Well, it's a little late on that.

298
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,794
This is what happens when you decide
to pay our bills with drug money.

299
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,192
Skyler...

300
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,031
...this isn't just about
what happened before.

301
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,716
My involvement in this is ongoing.

302
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,556
Understand?

303
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,479
I can't just quit.

304
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,796
I have something of a contract.

305
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,838
But it's all very safe, professional.

306
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,958
Structured.

307
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,754
Like, I can't simply quit.

308
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,075
Where you going?

309
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,799
If you're gonna launder money,
Walt...

310
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,714
...at least do it right.

311
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,510
You worked here four years.

312
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,716
It's a business you understand.

313
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,030
It's a story people will believe.

314
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,430
Not laser tag, this.

315
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,589
This is what we buy.

316
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,798
You.

317
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,990
This is what you buy.

318
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,310
Yeah, I mean, there's free donuts.
Nothing's wrong with a free donut.

319
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,833
Hey, Jesse, right?

320
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,833
Brandon, Peter.
How goes it? Hanging in there?

321
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,956
Can we please, just...?

322
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,189
Dumb-ass.

323
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,759
Sorry, man.
I was trying to keep it on the DL.

324
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,833
So you and that girl, do the deed yet?

325
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,713
Do what?

326
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,270
You know, sell to her?

327
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,791
What are you two even doing here?

328
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,669
What do you mean?

329
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,109
You can't get your nut up to sell,
what's the point of even coming?

330
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,840
Homey, I'm on, like, step five.

331
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,150
Deuce, yo. I'm catching up.

332
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,993
Whatever. Later.

333
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,038
Hey.

334
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,794
Dude needs to come into the fold.

335
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,879
Yup.

336
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,070
Hey, you know what?
I have magical powers.

337
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,719
You wanna see?

338
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,318
Ready?

339
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,632
That's not real.

340
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,678
It is real. All right,
do you wanna see something real?

341
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,398
Look at this. Watch this.

342
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,789
Ready?

343
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,478
You like that?

344
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,310
That's science and stuff,
makes it do that.

345
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,394
- Do it again.
- Let Jesse... eat his dinner, Brock.

346
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,279
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.
Wanna see it again?

347
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,908
Could you do a trick
with firecrackers?

348
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,271
Firecrackers?

349
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,989
You know,
I don't have any firecrackers on me.

350
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,311
- Who does tricks with firecrackers?
- Tomas.

351
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,598
Tomas does tricks with firecrackers,
huh? Who's Tomas?

352
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,274
- He's my kid brother.
- Yeah?

353
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,078
And we don't talk about him.

354
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,789
Come on, eat your food, Brock.

355
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,948
Can I have a chip?
I'm gonna steal your chip.

356
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,792
Hey, that's mine.

357
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,871
That's it?
That's what you wanna buy?

358
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,713
People will believe it, at least.

359
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,917
I worked here for four years.

360
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,310
"Wax on, wax off," was that you?

361
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,560
Hey, how come you guys
always give air freshener?

362
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,790
I explicitly say, "No air freshener<i>"...</i>

363
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,919
...and every time, I drive away
smelling like an Alpine whorehouse.

364
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:05,229
All due respect, I don't see it.
So I vote no.

365
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,437
It makes a better story
than your laser tag.

366
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,949
Is that you talking or Yoko Ono?

367
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,719
She has a point. It makes more sense
that I invest right here.

368
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,634
Based on her years of experience
in money laundering, I suppose.

369
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,270
If you're committed enough,
you can make any story work.

370
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,159
I once convinced a woman
that I was Kevin Costner...

371
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,392
...and it worked because I believed it,
all right?

372
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,630
Has nothing to do with the story.

373
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,709
Besides, this dump isn't gonna work
because it doesn't have a Danny.

374
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,108
There's no Danny here.

375
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,069
What in God's name is a Danny?

376
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,233
Danny runs the laser tag.
Danny is the guy who had a vision.

377
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,837
Where others saw a dirt lot,
he saw black lights, rubber aliens...

378
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,560
...teenagers running around
with ray guns, right?

379
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,438
Like Bugsy Siegel in the desert.

380
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,910
When the stock market took a shit
and Danny got into trouble...

381
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,755
...he went searching for exactly
the type of situation we're offering.

382
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,754
Danny will look the other way
to keep his dream afloat.

383
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:09,629
In other words,
Danny can be trusted completely.

384
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,148
That guy, the guy with the... eyebrows
that won't quit, is he a Danny?

385
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,559
You buy this place, all you got
is a big building that squirts water.

386
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,909
You got no Danny here.

387
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,916
You wanna stay for dinner?

388
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,633
Yeah.

389
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,632
Thanks.

390
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,037
What time is it?

391
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,471
Early still.

392
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,392
So...

393
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,471
What?

394
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,719
Thought maybe if you're holding,
we can do something.

395
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,592
What?

396
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,555
You know, that blue stuff
you were talking about.

397
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,473
- Maybe you had a line on some?
- Wait.

398
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,278
What?

399
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,110
Thought you said
the kid is coming home.

400
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,153
Yeah, in a few hours.

401
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,476
And you seriously wanna get high?

402
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,629
I don't know what
you're getting pissed about.

403
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,995
You're the one who brought it up.

404
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:31,709
Yeah, that was before
I found out you got a kid.

405
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,758
What kind of mother are you?

406
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,239
What?

407
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,154
You heard me. What kind of mom
gets wasted with a kid to take care of?

408
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,391
Nobody can say
I don't take care of my son.

409
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,437
You come in my house
and judge me?

410
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,717
Like you got no responsibilities
so it's okay for you?

411
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,233
What do you know about me?

412
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,960
I take care of my baby.
I'll do anything for him.

413
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,317
The day Brock was born, I swore...

414
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,230
...I won't let what happened to Tomas,
happen to my son.

415
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,870
I'll die first.

416
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,710
Sorry. I...

417
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,271
I just...

418
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,476
Look, I'll get out of here if you want.

419
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,477
That's what you wanna do, then go.

420
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,312
It's not what I want.

421
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,519
Look, I was out of line
talking about that stuff.

422
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,597
We both were.

423
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,552
You're right...

424
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,877
...I don't know
what you've been through.

425
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,270
You can tell me if you want.

426
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,913
This whole neighbourhood's
run by gangs.

427
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,075
They run the drugs,
control the streets.

428
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,471
They sort of took Tomas in.

429
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,035
No dad around.

430
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,236
Eight years old...

431
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,155
...they got Tomas slinging.

432
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,796
Part of some crew.

433
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:22,153
Then when he was 10...

434
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,389
...for some initiation or something...

435
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,838
...they made him kill somebody.

436
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,719
I heard the rumours.
I didn't believe it at first.

437
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,314
But then I saw him like a week later.

438
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,910
And he told me, yeah, he did it.

439
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,836
They gave Tomas a gun.

440
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,671
Gave him a choice.

441
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,634
Him or some dude.

442
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,791
So he did it.

443
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,073
Told me all about it
like it was nothing.

444
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,595
Who did he say he killed?

445
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,397
Some dealer.

446
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,597
From some outside crew.

447
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,312
Right around the corner from here,
over off of Central.

448
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,150
Just rode up on his bike
and shot him.

449
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,711
Off of Central?

450
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,799
Like over by the train tracks?

451
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,591
When was this?

452
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,910
Few months back.

453
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,036
What else did he tell you?

454
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,433
He shot the guy
right through the neck.

455
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,471
Shot him dead.

456
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,552
Just because he was working
the wrong corner.

457
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,116
It won't happen again.

458
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,912
Not to my son.

459
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,592
Guess what.

460
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,948
People who say "guess what" and
then actually expect you to guess...

461
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,872
...I hate those people.

462
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,632
Well, I just heard...

463
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:48,351
...about a certain patient
named Schrader-comma-Hank...

464
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,796
...who is going to be released
at the... end of this week.

465
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,668
Isn't that fantastic?

466
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,070
They plan on rolling me
out the front door?

467
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,312
Or put me on a greased plank
and slide me out the window?

468
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,038
Hey.

469
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,109
I don't care what any damned
insurance company thinks.

470
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,239
- I'm not leaving here till I'm well.
- Hank, this isn't about insurance.

471
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,678
I've talked to everybody, they all say
you are healthy enough to go home.

472
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,435
- I'm healthy enough, huh? Yeah.
- Hank, you get stronger every day.

473
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,556
You don't need to be in a hospital.

474
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,678
In this condition, yeah, I do.

475
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,638
You'll be just as comfortable at home
as you are here.

476
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,509
- You'll have all the same... equipment.
- Same... equipment? What's that mean?

477
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:35,434
The... equipment that you have here,
that you need. Short-term.

478
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,558
You'll do your PT at home
and it'll be great...

479
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,393
...because you'll be home.

480
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,791
Wait till you see the bedroom.
I had them move the plasma in.

481
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,996
I know that's how
you always wanted it.

482
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,674
You only had to get shot to get it,
right?

483
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,071
- I got you a new bed...
- A hospital bed?

484
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,949
Well...

485
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,714
You put a hospital bed
in my bedroom?

486
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,592
Hank...

487
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,273
...you'll be home.

488
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,309
You get that out of my house.

489
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,397
You hear me, Marie?

490
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,914
Today.

491
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,395
- Hank...
- I leave this hospital...

492
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,237
...when I walk out of here.
You understand?

493
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,829
And not before.

494
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,279
What's a Danny?

495
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,192
Danny's an accomplice.

496
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,911
Someone who's in on the scheme,
who knows about laundering...

497
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,435
...who's paid to look the other way.

498
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,475
Now, while I agree with you
that laser tag is a hard sell...

499
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,269
...without a Danny,
the car wash isn't really an option.

500
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,513
And he can't get you another Danny
to run the car wash?

501
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,277
Easier said than done.

502
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,591
If we're looking
for someone trustworthy.

503
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,549
What about me?

504
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,198
What about you?

505
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,713
Me.

506
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,508
I'll be the Danny.

507
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,990
No. No, no, Skyler,
that is not a good idea.

508
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,355
I'm capable of managing
a small business.

509
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,112
A legal business, not this.

510
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,679
Who else could we trust?

511
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,796
- No.
- Walt...

512
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,599
...I'm in this.

513
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,638
- And if I'm in it, I'm gonna do it right.
- No.

514
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,634
- You are not in this. You are not...
- We're married, how am I not in this?

515
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,189
We are not married, Skyler,
we're divorced.

516
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,479
Right?

517
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:56,314
I never actually got around
to filing the papers.

518
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,277
Married couples can't be compelled
to testify against one another.

519
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,510
So there's that.

520
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,316
Jesse. Jesse.

521
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,633
Respirator.

522
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,712
Right.

523
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,669
Yes?

524
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,437
Yes, all right. Okay.

525
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,357
Yeah, I'll be there.

526
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,352
What was that?

527
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,270
An invitation.

528
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,956
Walter, you're right on time.

529
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,190
Please, come in.

530
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,720
I hope you like paila marina.

531
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,474
It's a fancy name for fish stew.

532
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,272
It sounds like a cliché, but indeed,
it's just like my mother used to make it.

533
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,950
Come on. You can help me cook.

534
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,838
This is a Chilean dish that I love...

535
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,389
...but I never get to make it.

536
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,638
Kids won't eat it.

537
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,277
But...

538
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,751
...you know how that is.

539
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,473
Sure.

540
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,553
Do you mind?

541
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,113
Would you slice the garlic?

542
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,757
Very thin.

543
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,674
Why did you invite me here?

544
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,071
We're working together...

545
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,470
...why not break bread together?

546
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,794
Now, the garlic?

547
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,955
It always amazes me the way the
senses work in connection to memory.

548
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,317
I mean, this stew is simply
an amalgam of ingredients.

549
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,155
Taken separately, these ingredients
alone don't remind me of anything.

550
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,390
I mean, not very much at all.

551
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,759
But in this precise combination,
the smell of this meal...

552
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,117
...instantly, it brings you back
to my childhood.

553
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,508
How is that possible?

554
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,995
Basically, it takes place
in the hippocampus.

555
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,759
Neural connections are formed.

556
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,276
The senses make the neurons
express signals...

557
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,275
...that go right back to the same part
of the brain as before.

558
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,630
Where memory is stored.

559
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,148
It's something called
relational memory.

560
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,556
Don't quote me on that, I'm...

561
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,474
I'm rusty on my biology.

562
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,835
That's very interesting.

563
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,438
Walter...

564
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,955
...I would like to help you, if I could.

565
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,836
Help me how?

566
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,390
Well, when I first started out,
I made a lot of mistakes.

567
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,352
More than I care to admit.

568
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,834
I wish I'd had someone
to advise me...

569
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,591
...because this life of ours...

570
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,479
...it can overwhelm.

571
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,960
You are a wealthy man now.

572
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,354
And one must learn to be rich.

573
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,717
To be poor, anyone can manage.

574
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,432
What advice do you have for me?

575
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,599
Never make the same mistake twice.

576
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,358
Hey.

577
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,553
What's up?

578
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,595
You...? You Tomas?

579
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,557
I heard you were the man.

580
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,438
Yeah, what you want?

581
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,471
Crystal.

582
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,632
You think you could hook me up?

583
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,395
- Three hundred.
- For a teenth?

584
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,630
Shit, come on, yo.

585
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,870
Three hundred.

586
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,230
Hey, what's up?

587
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,996
Hey, yo.

588
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,392
Bounce.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00

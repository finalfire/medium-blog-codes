1
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,279
- Well, hello there.
- Hi, I hope we're not too late.

2
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,032
- No, no. Perfect timing.
- Okay.

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,111
- Stan, this is my husband, Walt.
- Hi.

4
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,191
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,351
- Sandia Laboratories, huh?
- Yeah.

6
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,988
I hear some fascinating stuff
goes on out there.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,718
Yeah, well, you know.

8
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,871
Working on anything
you can talk about?

9
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,793
I'm picturing giant space lasers.
Am I right?

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,713
Honestly, what I do
would bore you senseless.

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,396
Giant space lasers? That sounds cool.
I'll bring it up at our next staff meeting.

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,597
- Well, just remember I get a cut.
- All right. It's a deal.

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,752
So this is it, honey. What do you say?
Wanna take a tour?

14
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,831
- Sure.
- Okay.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,712
Look, how about
I give ya'll some privacy?

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,237
I'll go out to the car, make a few calls.
Take as much time as you need.

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,069
- All right.
- Okay, thanks.

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,109
- He's a nice guy. He doesn't push.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,751
So as you can see,
there's this kind of flow going on here.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,751
- It's a nice big living room.
- Yeah.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,515
And this is the dining area.

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,832
- Oh, the dining area. Right.
- Yes. Oh, and...

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,879
...it's got a pool.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,600
Pool is nice.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,479
Backyard could be a little bigger.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,475
And... Oh, there's a breakfast bar
kind of dealie here, which is nice.

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,473
And, I don't know,
the kitchen's really spacious...

28
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,393
...and, you know,
got good appliances and...

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,232
How many bedrooms?

30
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,231
Three. Told you.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,359
They're all pretty good size and...
Oh, this is the first one here.

32
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,875
And then there's two more
at the back.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,951
Only three bedrooms?

34
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,759
We're gonna need at least five,
don't you think?

35
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,399
- Five?
- Yeah.

36
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,154
What, do I look like
I'm about to drop a litter?

37
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,474
No, no, no.
We'll have three kids total, eventually.

38
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,108
Yeah, but we'll need
a spare room for a study...

39
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,317
...so that I can work at home
and you can write.

40
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,112
Yeah, no.
I don't think this is gonna be... enough.

41
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,073
Okay, what about a wine cellar?

42
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,915
I mean, we certainly cannot be
expected to live without a wine cellar.

43
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,959
Very funny. I just think we need
to set our sights high is all.

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,875
- At least, higher than here.
- Walt, this is a good neighbourhood.

45
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,077
It's got a good elementary
and a very good high school...

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,030
...and believe me, because I have
definitely looked everywhere.

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,839
For our price range,
this is as good as it gets.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,878
Well, then let's stretch our price range.

49
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,678
Truly. I mean, why...?

50
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,879
Why buy a starter house when we'll
have to move out in a year or two?

51
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,315
Did you win the lottery
and not tell me?

52
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,232
I'm serious.

53
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,710
Come on. Why be cautious?

54
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,678
We've got nowhere to go but up.

55
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,678
- Yeah.
<i>- Walter, you see us?</i>

56
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,319
Yeah. I see you.

57
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,232
<i>I'd lik e you to exit your vehicle</i>
<i>and start walking toward us.</i>

58
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,109
And then what?
I'm gonna need some...

59
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,279
Some kind of assurance.

60
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,319
<i>I assure you,</i>
<i>I could kill you from way over here...</i>

61
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,074
<i>...if it mak es you feel any better.</i>

62
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,508
Walter, you've been busy.

63
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,355
You wanna put your arms out
to your sides for me, if you would?

64
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,399
You know I haven't slept
since Thursday?

65
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,438
I was out all night
cleaning up after you.

66
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,352
I need my sleep.

67
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,434
You said no half measures.

68
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:34,038
Yeah. Funny how words can be so open
to interpretation.

69
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,037
- You get your car fixed?
- Not yet.

70
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,430
You're gonna wanna
get your car fixed.

71
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,398
Let's see how this goes first.

72
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,749
Has your condition worsened?

73
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,640
- Excuse me?
- Your medical condition.

74
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,633
- Has it grown worse?
- Not that I know of, no.

75
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,314
Is there a ringing in your ears?

76
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,914
Are you seeing bright lights
or hearing voices?

77
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,632
- I'm quite well, thank you.
- No. Clearly, you are not.

78
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:39,031
No rational person would do
as you have done.

79
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,913
Explain yourself.

80
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,670
My partner was about
to get himself shot.

81
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,273
I inte... ned.

82
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,795
Some worthless junkie.

83
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,953
For him, you inte... ne
and put us all at risk.

84
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,795
Some contemptible junkie who couldn't
keep the peace for eight hours.

85
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,315
That's right. He couldn't.

86
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,909
He was angry
because those dealers of yours...

87
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,150
...had just murdered
an 11 -year-old boy.

88
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,117
I heard about it.

89
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,953
He should have
let me take care of them.

90
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,792
Maybe.

91
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:17,954
Then again, maybe he thought
it was you who gave the order.

92
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,191
Are you asking me
if I ordered the murder of a child?

93
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,280
I would never ask you that.

94
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,432
Where is Pinkman now?

95
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,470
I wouldn't know.

96
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,038
Couple of time zones away, at least.

97
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,478
Beyond that, I'd only be guessing.

98
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,918
He has enough money to last forever,
he knows he needs to keep moving.

99
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,593
You'll never find him.

100
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,591
I don't know, Walt...

101
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
...it's what I do, after all.

102
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,677
He's out of the picture.

103
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,753
I saved his life, I owed him that,
but now he and I are done.

104
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,992
Which is exactly what you wanted,
isn't it?

105
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,638
You've always struck me
as a very pragmatic man.

106
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,156
So if I may,
I would like to review options with you.

107
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,074
Of which, it seems to me,
you have two.

108
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,157
Option A:

109
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,118
You kill me right here and now.

110
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,114
Apparently,
I have made that very easy for you.

111
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,794
You can kill me, no witnesses...

112
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,635
...and then spend the next few weeks
or months...

113
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,519
...tracking down Jesse Pinkman
and you kill him too.

114
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,913
A pointless exercise, it seems to me,
but that is option A.

115
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,672
What is option B?

116
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,193
I continue cooking.

117
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,115
You and I both forget about Pinkman.

118
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,475
We forget this ever happened.

119
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,200
We consider this a Ione hiccup...

120
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,990
...in an otherwise long
and fruitful business arrangement.

121
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,949
I prefer option B.

122
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,435
You'd need a new assistant.

123
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,715
- I could get right on that.
- No.

124
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,030
This time, I choose.

125
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,158
Your car...

126
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,958
...get it fixed.

127
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,633
Yeah.

128
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,196
Really?

129
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,113
It's good to see you.

130
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,438
Thanks.

131
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,516
It's good to be back.

132
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,271
Well, shall we?

133
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,274
By all means, Gale, let's cook.

134
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,352
What about that rhinoceros?
You think he'd make a good pet?

135
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,078
- No.
- No?

136
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,800
Don't you think if you called,
he'd come running?

137
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,872
I bet he would.
I bet he'd come running:

138
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,789
You're silly, Pop-Pop.

139
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,918
Well, a little. But he'd probably
knock everything over.

140
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,517
- Plus, there's that big nose of his.
- That's not a nose, that's a horn.

141
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,719
- Is that so?
- His real nose is little.

142
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,036
I learn all kinds of things
being with you.

143
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,031
Okay, June bug, these are for you.

144
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,430
- What about the rest?
- The rest are for me.

145
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,034
No, they're not.
You're too old for balloons.

146
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,428
You're never too old for balloons.
Give me a hug.

147
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,796
I see your mama.
Don't keep her waiting.

148
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,349
- Bye, Pop-Pop.
- Bye, baby.

149
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,557
Hi, sweetie.
Did you have fun with Pop-Pop?

150
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,918
Please. Please, no.

151
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,239
Chow, you have anything
you wanna tell me?

152
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,039
Thank God you're here.
They keep me prisoner.

153
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,954
- They keep you prisoner.
- I don't do nothing for them ever.

154
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,157
They try and make me. I say, no.

155
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,235
They steal my chemicals.
I can't stop them. I am businessman.

156
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,834
You're a business...
The lady out front...

157
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,436
Hey, lady, are you still there?
Ask her if she's still there.

158
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,119
She says, yes.

159
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,830
How's her driving? Driving.
Is she good behind the wheel?

160
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,355
Good. She's good driver.

161
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,114
Licensed? Dependable?

162
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,554
She has a Camry.

163
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,229
Good.

164
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,993
The trucks will be here
first thing in the morning.

165
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,835
I strongly recommend
that you return our calls next time.

166
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,116
So have her drive you to the hospital.

167
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,078
She's gonna need her shoe.

168
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,237
- Where'd they cross?
- Laredo, looks like.

169
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,960
They didn't exactly send
their A players.

170
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,032
But like you said, it's cartel, all right.

171
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,996
Probing for weakness.

172
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,629
Well, they didn't find any.

173
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,312
What about Pinkman?

174
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,640
I'm making enquiries.

175
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,515
Yeah, that's two.
All right, let's close it up.

176
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,553
All right, bring it down.

177
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,192
You ready?

178
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,710
Okay, we're good.

179
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,520
You can take your mask off now.

180
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,951
Does that guy ever leave?

181
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,600
When exactly did that start?

182
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,917
It's new.

183
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,475
We had a...

184
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,029
We had a little drama
with the person you replaced.

185
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,353
- Sorry to hear that.
- No, it'll be fine.

186
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,637
Things will continue
to smooth out and...

187
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,076
Yeah, it'll be fine.

188
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,797
By the way, if you're at all worried
about working with me...

189
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,791
No, I'm not.

190
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,951
Whatever my shortcomings
last time...

191
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,271
...I intend for things to go perfectly
from here on out.

192
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,910
- So if there is...?
- Gale, you're great.

193
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,674
- Seriously.
- I just...

194
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,755
However you like things to be done
is exactly how we're gonna do them.

195
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,717
Period.

196
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,277
From here on out, so...

197
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,793
Please, teach me.

198
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,838
Okay.

199
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,716
Gale. It's good to see you.

200
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,472
Mr. Fring.

201
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,198
Wow, this is...

202
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,511
I should have called.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

203
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,550
No. No, no, not at all.
Please, come in.

204
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,835
Can I offer you something?
A crème de menthe?

205
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,594
No. No, thank you.

206
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,196
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

207
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,399
Oh, no, no. It's no inconvenience.

208
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,234
I need to talk to you
about something.

209
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,755
Something rather pressing.

210
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,350
If push came to shove,
I was wondering...

211
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,274
...how soon you might be able
to take over the lab yourself.

212
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,556
You and an assistant.

213
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,878
Why would...?

214
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,073
- Why would push come to shove?
- Has Walter ever talked to you...

215
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,710
...about why he got into
this particular line of work?

216
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,080
I guess I assumed
it was because it pays so well.

217
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,800
It is, but specifically...

218
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,838
...has he... ever spoken to you
about his health problems?

219
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,593
I'm not surprised.
He's a very private person.

220
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,952
What exactly
are his health problems?

221
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,270
He's dying of cancer.

222
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,515
It is why he does this, to provide for
his family, which he's accomplished.

223
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,709
They will never want for anything,
he's seen to that.

224
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,234
How long does he have?

225
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,354
That is very much the question.

226
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,713
He does not wanna talk about it.
And every time I bring it up with him...

227
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,148
I don't know that he's fully accepted
the reality of it.

228
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,915
And not to sound cold-blooded,
but I am running a business here.

229
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,911
- No, I understand.
- I have a very large investment in this.

230
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,117
There's so much overhead
that I can't afford to shut down.

231
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,633
Not even for a week.

232
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,076
So you understand my concern.

233
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,198
And my desire for continuity.

234
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,759
I do. Absolutely.

235
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,993
Now, I intend to keep Walter on
as long as he wants...

236
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:47,914
...assuming that
he's physically up to it.

237
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,598
But as he cannot or will not tell me
how long that might be...

238
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,436
...I must prepare
for the worst-case scenario.

239
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,589
Well, worst-case scenario...

240
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,473
I suppose if we had...

241
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,799
...at least a few more cooks together.

242
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,997
You don't think you're ready now?

243
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,276
Well, I mean...

244
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,874
...he is such a...

245
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,149
A master.

246
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,469
There's always more for me to learn.

247
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,196
But I'm thinking that if we had...

248
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,032
...say...

249
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,392
...one or two more cooks.

250
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,957
One more...

251
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,875
...I guess would do it. I suppose.

252
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,389
I believe in you, Gale.

253
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,919
I know that when the time comes,
you will be ready.

254
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,914
What's up?

255
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,830
Walt, is there...?

256
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,993
Any particular trick
to purging the catalyst bed?

257
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,751
No, it's pretty straightforward.
I'll show you when we get there.

258
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,198
Yeah?

259
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,551
Tell him I'm in conference.

260
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,317
- I'm in conference.
- I'm looking to find a client of yours.

261
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,119
I was hoping you could help me out
with an address.

262
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,317
- Which client?
- Jesse Pinkman.

263
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,474
Jesse-Pinkman-in-the-phone-book
Jesse Pinkman.

264
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,030
How would one track him down,
I wonder.

265
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,832
- You're still here.
- I need your full attention, Saul.

266
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,077
Jesse Pinkman.
Current whereabouts.

267
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,789
The sooner you tell me, the sooner
you get back to whatever this is.

268
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,111
What am I, an 8th-grade hall monitor?
Current whereabouts.

269
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:49,229
- Let me tell you something, Mike, you...
- Whoa, you are good right there.

270
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,433
Now, let's both get comfortable.

271
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,270
Now, when I say,
I'm looking for Pinkman...

272
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,670
...we both know why, don't we?

273
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,073
You pretending otherwise only wastes
my time and se... s to annoy me.

274
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,673
Look, Mike...

275
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,479
...there are rules to this lawyer thing.

276
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,631
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

277
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,075
Attorney-client privilege.
That's a big one.

278
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,310
That's something I provide for you.

279
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,277
So if I give up Pinkman...

280
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,796
...then you're gonna be asking,
"Saul gives them up pretty easy.

281
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,428
What's to keep him
from giving me up?" You see?

282
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,477
So then, where's the trust?

283
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,909
I trust the hole in the desert
I'd leave you in.

284
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,397
Yeah, that's an argument.

285
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,477
Saul...

286
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,753
...don't make me beat you
till your legs don't work.

287
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:47,073
Now tell me where to find him.
You know it's the right thing.

288
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,269
I can't tell you, Mike, all right? I...

289
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,189
Look, if I was to tell you, well, I just...
I couldn't live with myself.

290
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,998
I'm sorry.

291
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,715
But who's to say I didn't write
the address down in my day planner?

292
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,236
Or on a scratch piece of paper
somewhere?

293
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,234
Who's to say
I didn't write down a location...

294
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,597
...strictly for
my own professional use?

295
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,675
Do not touch anything on my desk.

296
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,674
I'm gonna leave the room,
make myself a Nescafé.

297
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,759
I'm just looking out for you, that's all.
Like a mother hen.

298
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,872
Money-laundering ain't what it used
to be. God, do I miss the... 80s.

299
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,154
You're wasting your time.
I'm buying the car wash, end of story.

300
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,949
Well, one look at this place,
you're gonna fall in love, so...

301
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,672
Was I right? Where... else you gonna find
a cash-only business that's this fun?

302
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,675
Unless we're talking massage parlours,
and, I don't see it. Shall we?

303
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,473
You ever actually play laser tag?

304
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,549
You know, it's good cardio.
Plus, you get to shoot at kids.

305
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,554
You got your bumper cars over there
down that way.

306
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,280
Got your arcade here,
all the latest video games.

307
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,274
Snack bar's there. Nothing stopping
you from selling beer to the parents.

308
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,389
- That's a whole new revenue stream...
- All right, already. We're good.

309
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,153
Holy Christ.

310
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,278
We're good? This constitutes good
where you're from?

311
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,159
- My car is bugged?
- I said, maybe. Maybe bugged.

312
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,392
I'm being followed?
What the hell have you gotten me into?

313
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,269
My own PI is threatening to break
my legs. That's like Thomas Magnum...

314
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,512
...threatening that little prissy guy
with the moustache.

315
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,911
Over and above.
Service-wise, this is over and above.

316
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,957
You and I survive this...

317
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,509
...I'm seriously rethinking
my pricing, yeah.

318
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,717
And that goes double for you,
Hip-Hop.

319
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,678
Okay, my guy's no dummy, right?

320
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:39,038
I give us maybe 24 hours before he
figures out that address goes nowhere.

321
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,794
You guys do your thing,
make it snappy.

322
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,236
I'll go see if they have".Tetris"
or something.

323
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,556
So how you holding up?

324
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,872
You?

325
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,317
I got my old job back.

326
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,677
At least until they kill me
and Gale takes over.

327
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,311
- So he's their boy, huh?
- He's their boy.

328
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,789
How long you think you've got?

329
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,919
Well, he asks a lot of questions
about the cooking process.

330
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,073
I try to be as vague as possible,
but I got that guy Victor watching me...

331
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,708
...listening to every word I say.

332
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,995
You know, maybe that the only thing
saving me is Gale's fastidiousness.

333
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:33,915
And once he feels confident
that he knows my entire method...

334
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,077
So, what do we do?

335
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,830
You know what we do.

336
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,513
There's got to be some other way.

337
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,629
Maybe it's better for you
to just go to the cops.

338
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,828
All right? I mean,
I can't believe I'm saying that and all...

339
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,911
...but for your family.

340
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,993
The DEA would love you,
all the shit you could tell them.

341
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,072
Federal witness protection,
that's a good deal.

342
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,995
As for me, I'll hit the road, yo.
I mean, I'll make it.

343
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,472
We had a good run.

344
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,551
But it's over.

345
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,555
Never the DEA.

346
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,472
The cook can't stop.

347
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,792
That's the one thing I'm certain of,
production cannot stop.

348
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,155
Gus can't afford to.

349
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,757
So if I'm the only chemist
that he's got...

350
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,038
...then I've got leverage,
and leverage keeps me alive.

351
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,476
It keeps you alive too.
I think I can see to that.

352
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,952
If I'm the only chemist that he's got.

353
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,913
I can't do it, Mr. White.

354
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,390
Like you said, I'm...

355
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,351
I'm not a...

356
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,836
I can't do it.

357
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,117
I'll do it.

358
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,996
I'm gonna need your help.

359
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:40,310
I mean,
they're watching me day and night.

360
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,597
They never leave me alone with Gale,
not for a moment.

361
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,274
Hell, I don't even know
where the man lives.

362
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,076
He's not in the phone book,
I can't find him on the Internet...

363
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,835
...and I can't do it in the lab,
Victor's always there.

364
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,756
But if I could just...

365
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,799
...shake Victor,
for even an hour one night...

366
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,269
...I think then that...

367
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,955
I may be able...

368
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,155
...to make it look like an accident.

369
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,477
There's got to be some other way.

370
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,390
I'm all ears.

371
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:24,271
But when it comes down to you and me
versus him, I'm sorry.

372
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,915
I'm truly sorry...

373
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,035
...but it's gonna be him.

374
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,509
Now, you are the only edge
that I've got...

375
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,478
...as long as they don't know
that you're in town.

376
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,871
But I need you to track him,
get me his address.

377
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,110
And I'll do the rest.

378
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,393
Look, I saved your life, Jesse.

379
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,035
Are you gonna save mine?

380
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,595
<i>Yeah?</i>

381
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,398
Please, tell me you found him.

382
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,998
<i>6353 Juan Tabo Boulevard.</i>
<i>Apartment 6.</i>

383
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,799
<i>- You there?</i>
- Yeah.

384
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,079
6353 Juan Tabo. Number 6. Got it.

385
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,711
- He's home?
<i>- Yep.</i>

386
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,115
Anyone watching the place?

387
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,670
<i>No. Looks pretty much wide-open.</i>

388
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,036
<i>When are you gonna do it?</i>

389
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,798
Tonight.

390
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,030
Once it gets dark.

391
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,077
<i>Don't do this, Mr. White.</i>

392
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:00,233
<i>Please. Go to the cops.</i>

393
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,159
We got a problem.

394
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,959
Some kind of chemical leaking
in your lab.

395
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,758
Better come with me.

396
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,036
I'll follow you.

397
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:46,113
They tell me to bring you, I bring you.
Come on, get in the car.

398
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,436
I don't know if it's a barrel leak...

399
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,751
...but you got something
mighty stinky down there.

400
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,191
After you.

401
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,319
Walter, the sooner you figure out what
this is, the sooner we all go home.

402
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,796
Please, don't do this.

403
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,911
Mike...

404
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,589
...you don't have to do this.

405
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,598
Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter.

406
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,318
Downstairs.

407
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,598
I'll cook. I'll cook for free. There won't
be any more trouble, I promise you.

408
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,352
- No.
- Lf I could talk to Gus...

409
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,317
- No.
...I can make him understand.

410
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,710
If I could talk to Gus,
I can convince him.

411
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,677
Just let me, please... Please.

412
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,469
- Please, let me talk to him.
- Shut up! Shut up.

413
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,269
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

414
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,311
I'll give you Jesse Pinkman.

415
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,836
Like you said, he's the problem.
He's always been the problem.

416
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,629
And without him, we would...
And he's in town, all right?

417
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,439
He's not in Virginia
or wherever you're looking.

418
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,751
He's right here in Albuquerque
and I could take you to him.

419
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,195
I'll take you right to him.

420
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,672
- What do you say?
- Where is he?

421
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,674
- Right now, you give me an address.
- I don't... He moves. He moves around.

422
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,479
But if you let me call him...
No, no, please.

423
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,234
No, I just... My phone. I'll just...

424
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,393
It's just my phone. I'll call him
and I'll have him meet me.

425
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,676
All right? Okay?

426
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,432
Okay?

427
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,515
Did you do it?

428
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,957
<i>Mr. White?</i>

429
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,191
<i>Did you do it?</i>

430
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,557
No, I didn't do it.

431
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,468
<i>I can't now.</i>

432
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,596
<i>- It's gonna have to be you.</i>
- What? No way, man.

433
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,797
You're closer than we are.
You'll have a 20-minute lead.

434
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,520
<i>They've got me,</i>
<i>they're going to kill me.</i>

435
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,830
- Jesse, do it now! Do it!
- Son of a bitch!

436
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,228
<i>Do it, Jesse! Do it!</i>

437
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,715
Just what the hell was that exactly?

438
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,598
You might wanna hold off.

439
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,159
Yeah?

440
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,075
- Why?
- Because your boss is gonna need me.

441
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,631
6353 Juan Tabo, Apartment 6.

442
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,075
Yeah.

443
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,028
Hi. How can I help you?

444
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,516
Take whatever you want.

445
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,995
I have money. I have...

446
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,674
I got a lot of money.

447
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,195
I have...

448
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,477
Please, don't do this.

449
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,076
You don't... You...

450
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,478
You... You don't have to do this.
